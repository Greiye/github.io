#### {{color:DarkRed Thorvinn}} Catches Up

The party rests from the previous battle with the tree people and the spiders.<br>

The dwarven paladin **Thorvinn** catches up with the party. He notices that among the party, there’s a kobold dressed as Welt.

###### The Human Welt turned Kobold
"Hi." Says the Kobold.

#### The Hunt for the Relic
The party continues toward the Faelands. Somewhere, the relic rests. Using Auri's Magic detection, they track necromantic magic.

#### A Shoddy Hut
Along the way, they encounter a makeshift hut, fit for a single person to reside in. The party peeks through the cabin's shoddy slits between the wood planks.

Completely black.

Auri takes a look. It's all gold-colored mana emenating from the equipment inside.

#### Ariella, the Elven Alchemist
Talk for a little bit.

##### {{color:DarkGray Dezi's Arm}}
Bring up Dezi's metal disease.
Source of corruption southeast. Potential location of relic?
Ariella says she will provide Alchemist Services in exchange for spring water. Quest.
Donkeys cared for, for a little bit.
Travel to get water for Ariella as a sidequest. The spring is about 1.5 days out from Ariella’s hut.
Given potions

#### The Springwater Quest
Surrounding area starts looking purple.
Party wakes up in a maze where everything is purple. Purple leaves, grass, etc.


### Travelling and waking to the Purple Haze
Party event occurs, something about potions.



### The Goblin Wizard
See a goblin wizard with a pink pointy hat.
Behind the goblin is an overpass. Pass the overpass, a large garden maze.
Someone in the group sees a blur. (The sneaky kobold from before?)
Some people pass the goblin 10 gold per head to get to the fountain.
Auri insults the goblins wizard using a frozen deer carcass from his backpack and a slightly rotten ring of goblin ears.
A red cap is summoned.

#### Insult
Auri mocks the goblin by shaping his waterbag’s contents into a smaller Auri, constantly killing the 2 goblins in front of him. This ultimately is the reason for the battle starting. Goblin Wizard: “The rest of you are fine, your friend however, will pay for this disrespect with his life.”
::
### BATTLE
Goblin Wizard attacks Auri.

His abs hurt from Tasha’s hideous laughter. 
He gets knocked out several times, his clothes are slightly hacked from Red Cap’s scythe. He has bruises from the Goblin Wizard's metal boots. The rest of the party isn’t too injured. 

The Party is annoyed at Auri. This entire battle could have been avoided.

{{descriptive
##### "This is the spring of life. Do not take it."

#### Pixie Town
Town that Ariella mentioned is full of pixies.

#### The Druidic Inn
Group rests at an inn run by a druid.
