[Back](ErubounesuWikiMain.md)

#### Thorvinn Catches Up
Rest from the previous battle
Date: Lunesta, 14th (About a month and some days since the start of the adventure)
Thorvinn catches up
Notices that there’s a kobold around dressed as Welt.
The Party is still headed towards the Relic in the Feylands.
Headed towards necromancer magic. (Northeast?)
Encounter a hut fit for 1 person. A peek through the cabin's shoddy slits between the wood planks is completely black. Auri takes a look, and with his magical vision, it's all mana colored gold.
(mana color of gold not confirmed, but assumed to be Celestial.)

#### Meet an elf woman named **Ariella**.
Talk for a little bit.
Bring up Dezi's metal disease.
Source of corruption southeast. Potential location of relic?
Ariella says she will provide Alchemist Services in exchange for spring water. Quest.
Donkeys cared for, for a little bit.
Travel to get water for Ariella as a sidequest. The spring is about 1.5 days out from Ariella’s hut.
Given potions
Surrounding area starts looking purple.
Party wakes up in a maze where everything is purple. Purple leaves, grass, etc.
See a goblin wizard with a pink pointy hat.
Behind the goblin is an overpass. Pass the overpass, a large garden maze.
Someone in the group sees a blur. (The sneaky kobold from before?)
Some people pass the goblin 10 gold per head to get to the fountain.
Auri insults the goblins wizard using a frozen deer carcass from his backpack and a slightly rotten ring of goblin ears.
A red cap is summoned.
Auri mocks the goblin by shaping his waterbag’s contents into a smaller Auri, constantly killing the 2 goblins in front of him. This ultimately is the reason for the battle starting. Goblin Wizard: “The rest of you are fine, your friend however, will pay for this disrespect with his life.”
