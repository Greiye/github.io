{{descriptive
##### The Region of Elsir Vale
Onesday, Firius 1, 1090

Morning

Assadorth

The Red Goblin Inn

}}
### Members of the Silver Dragon

Inside the Red Goblin Inn, a red Tiefling is causing a stir.
:
**Muscular Tiefling**


"No, no, no! This will not do!" The equipment is all dirty, the food's all close to rotting out, and it looks like its been kept cold in an ice bath for weeks. Even the lettuce! next to the radishes??! what kind of establishment is this? I can't work with these conditions around me!
:
I am a ***FLAMEHEART***, do you understand? If you knew that that surname meant, you'd have half a mind to clean this place up!"


:
An older chef in her 40's is recieving this critic.
:
**Older Chef**

"... Who even are you?
:
On the other tavern side, a half-elf monk sits with 10 flagons of ale. A halfling with 2 crucibles on each side of him is sitting happily at a table. The table is a little to tall for him.

An emaciated human in formal clothing sits at a corner table, reading a tome. The bandages around his forearms could be from disease, or something that the young man is covering up.

A dragonborn with a red bandage over his eyes sits alone by the bar counter. He is drinking soup like a lizard. 

A ruckus ensues, which ends with these adventurers sitting close to each other.

The Dragonborn's bandage over his eyes make for a conversation between all of them. It bears the symbol of the Silver Dragon Guild.
Through conversation, they realize that each of them all affiliated with the Silver Dragon Guild.

they quickly introduce themselves and agree to work together.

Name | Race and Occupation
-- | -- 
Auri | Dragonborn Sorcerer
Dezi | Gnome Artificer
Zephyr | Elven Monk
Sera | Teifling Cookbard
Welt | Human Warlock Doctor

They were all sent here to find a missing girl.

### Looking for The Blacksmith’s Daughter


They interview some of the local people around. 
:
"Blacksmith's Daughter? Have you seen the blacksmith's daughter? Anyone?"
:
"No one is responding to us.
:
"Hey, You. Teenager. Where is the blacksmith's daughter?"
:
**Teenager**

"Seven Hells if I know, green gills. I've never seen you around, I've been living here all my life. You try talking tooooo... ***the blacksmith***? abouuuuuut *the blacksmith's daughter*? Not the sharpest tool, are you? Damn weirdo band..."
:

"Man, why didn't we think of that?"
:
Using their combined brainpower, they deduce that the best person to go to about the blacksmith's daughter is the blacksmith himself.



### The Blacksmith Kane

The party goes to the blacksmith's smithy and meets Kane, a Halfling blacksmith. They find out several key pieces of information, including her potential whereabouts and what she looks like. The daughter's name is Keele, a Halfling child with red hair, last seen wearing a commoner's shirt and pants.

The party departs, headed to what the locals call The Boar Forest. There, they find humanoid tracks as described by the blacksmith. They follow the tracks.

{{note
##### Collecting Spoils
While following tracks, Auri and Welt find 9 types of medicinal herbs. (5 and 4, respectively). They are later dried out and preserved for future use.
}} 





\page
### A Talk by the Campfire

The party gathers around the campfire and shares with each other a brief overview of who they are and what they seek.


Sure, here is the information in a markdown table:

| Name | Quest |
|------|-------------|
| **Seraphina “Sera” Flameheart** | A Tiefling Cook who wishes to prove herself to her family's lineage of cooks. |
| **Zephyr Ironfist** | A Half-Elf Monk who solves every problem with punches. He seeks to solve the problem that is his father. |
| **Welt** | A Plague Doctor who seeks knowledge. |
| **Dezi** | A Halfling Artificer with a metallurgical disease that he wishes to cure. |
| **Auri** | A seemingly blind Silver Dragonborn magic user who is looking for his lost dragonborn tribe. He joined the guild for magic. |
| **Zephyr** | Wants to solve the problem that is his father with his fists. |
| **Welt** | Seeks knowledge and secrets of medicine. |
| **Seraphina** | Wants to prove herself to her family. |
| **Dezi** | Reveals his 'ferroderma' condition, as he puts it, and seeks a cure. Welt is intrigued by this condition. |
| **Auri** | Puts on a show, using magic to manipulate water. He shows that he was blinded as a child and that he's looking for his lost clan of fellow Silver Dragonborn. |

With a 3-shift night watch, the party rests until daybreak.

**End of Session 1**

{{descriptive

Twosday, Firius 2, 1090

Morning

Boar Forest

}}

### The Search for Keele
Party wakes at 5am, close to sun up, hungry. Group decides to forage for food (the group goes to get boar; Auri goes fishing).

#### New Companions
While hunting for boars, the group meets a couple; both bear the symbol of the Silver Dragon Guild:

Lady Cass takes the form of a beautiful human woman whose clothes are immaculately clean. Her guild symbol is on her necklace. 
Thorvin is a young dwarf paladin man, adorned with a black and red hooded chainmail. In his hands, a warhammer and shield with the guild’s symbol at the front.

Zephyr asks who they are. Upon learning that they are from the guild, Zephyr asks that they help catch breakfast. Welt shares that he is a warlock bound by a contract with Oberon, the king of fairies. His contract binds him so that he must protect the forest unless given certain circumstances (necessity and/or threatened)
Sera takes the boar meat and cooks a meal for the party. Despite the attractive look of the meal, it tastes bad.
The group heads off after spending 3 hours on breakfast.
The Boar Forest begins to taper off into The Plains.


### The Green Plains
{{descriptive

Twosday, Firius 2, 1090

Noon

The Plains

}}
The party peek over a hill. At the bottom of the hill are 4 goblins, guarding a ravaged door that leads into the hill. The group splits in two and begin their assault on the goblins.

### Battle : Goblin Scouts
The goblins see the party and retaliate. They are quickly dispatched thanks to a sleep and entangle spell. A goblin patrol appears over the hill and continues the assault as soon as the group heads through the door. Past the door is a narrow hallway (5ft. wide) that is pitch black.
In the first room, a fire brassiere. Some people in the group are seeing that this could be some shrine to Selune.
Second room contains 3 goblins. The group handles these goblins while Thorvinn defends the rear from the goblins outside.
Auri gets incapacitated (2 arrows from the patrol team, up on the hill outside)

Healed back to health by Thorvinn.

### A Mysterious Tomb

Zephyr triggers scythe traps
With the goblin patrol eliminated, the group takes a short rest (1 hour).
They enter a small room (6x10 squares?) with pillars and a shrine at the end. There stands 4 goblins, a hobgoblin and a bugbear. The Blacksmith's Daughter, Keele, caged in the furthest corner.


### Battle: The Hob Goblin
The group defeats the enemies with 1 casualty (Auri ofc) (Javelin to the ribcage)

The enemies are looted (longbow, longsword, chainmail, 3 javelins)
Auri slices off goblin ears from the bodies. 16 in total, including the bugbear and the hobgoblin


Covered in blood and mysterious substances, Zephyr violently grabs at the bars of Keele’s cage, ensuring her that she is safe and will soon be taken out of the cage.
Keele is freed by Dezi and examined by Welt. She has no major injuries but is extremely malnourished. She is given rations.

They find a puzzle and a note
"The more you take of me, the less there is"
“Footprints”
Magical footprints lead to the corner of the room. A loose rock switch is discovered. The wall slides up, revealing that the magic footprints leads downstairs .Thorvinn detects undead further down.

\page
### Treasure
Thorvinn discovers a treasure room

#### Potential: The Tomb of Artesh
“Artesh: the Goblin Slayer. Follower of Bahamut.”

Someone mentioned that this may be the tomb of Artesh (Welt or Dezi said this)

Someone mentions something about a human sacrifice at dawn.


A Note written in Goblin found in the area:

{{descriptive

Threesday, Firius 3, 1090

Day 3 of Adventure

Morning

Boar Forest

}}
#### Returning Keele to Kane
After successfully rescuing Keele from the Goblin infested tomb of Artesh, the party heads back to Assadorth
Lots of travelers in and out of assadorth
Town guard recognizes Keele. The guard advises us to return Keele quickly.
The Well
The party sees a well in the center of town. Over the well there are strange writings.
There is magic emanating from the well. Auri is helped by Thorvin to read out the sign on the well. "It sounds of Bahamut, the dragon god."
Welt throws a coin in. A local townsperson sees this and approaches. “Ah I see you worship Bahamut as well.”
The group returns to bringing Keele home. The father and daughter are reunited.
Kale asks “what happened to the other adventurers?”
The group thinks about it for a little bit. Some of them flashback to the undead mana emanating from the lower levels of the tomb. It is assumed that the previous visitors of the tomb have perished.)

Kane: As a reward for rescuing my daughter Keele,I want to give you folks a few magical artifacts.　I will also talk to the Red Dragon Inn and pay for the night’s accommodations; dinner and the rooms.

“I wish for you to have this.This coin has been in my family for some generations now.”

#### Kane's Mysterious Coin
The group has received a small coin. The faces are the same on each side. Auri senses that this item is enchanted.The group spends a fair amount of time examining the coin and its magical properties.
The Market District
The party heads to the business district to resupply. They visit the Tanner, the Trader, and the Leatherworker.
Sera manages to pawn all seven paintings that they found in the tomb of Artesh for 30gp each.
Welt commissions for a kind of leather carrier for Dezi and Zephyr.

### Shopping
Auri buys hide armor for 9gp from Tanner the Tanner(Leatherworker) and a Rapier for 25gp. Also caltrops and manacles. The 16 goblin ears begin to rot in his pack. Auri asks if any townsfolk collect these ears as a mark of lessened goblins. They tell him no. Seeing no use to the ears, Auri discreetly throws them in a random ditch by the roadside. 

Auri asks the locals if they've seen any silver dragonborns like him around. The Locals share that more information about them can be found in Brindol, Specifically from those that follow Bahamut. The chromatic dragon God would know about all of his subjects. They also tell him to check with the wizard up in the tower.

\page

### Oddman of the Party
Auri earns 3 gold trying to pass as a blind beggar. Dezi and Welt throw stones at him.

Thorvinn attempted to buy 200gp of armor, but the armor was too expensive.

The group is still perplexed by the coin that Kane gave them.
After shopping around, they again find themselves in front of the Bahamut well. The coin shines after being dipped. The shining light fails mid flip. Any attempt to mark the coin fails, any magic mark or smudge of blood is removed the moment the coin flips in the air.

The party takes a drink of the well’s water. They are revitalized.


### The Church

We go to the local church, which bears the symbol of Selune. A guard stops us, only allowing some of us inside. Welt and Thorvin enter.
When asked about Bahamut, the local priest or presbyter tells us that the markings of the Silver Dragon Guild are the same markings of Bahamut. Our Guild shares ties with the religion. Our current guild is considered the new guild, replacing the old one. (After that, the Sister said something about the sister of Selune?)

Welt: what was the issue with the old guild?
The Sister points to the graveyard,
Welt: Oh.

There are rumors of Goblins worshiping Tiamat, beginning to ritually sacrifice humans to appease the lord.
The Sister mentions Lorellia Vildremant (I think?) .The name of the Wizard.

Welt and Auri go to the wizard tower. A secretary meets us inside. “Wizard not here. come back tomorrow.”

### The Stable
The group stops at the stable and inquires about horses.
- Horses for 75gp
- Donkey for 8gp
- Wagon is 35gp

\page
### The Inn
The group goes to the Inn to rest.

Zephyr and Sera go right to sleep.
Welt studies the herbs collected in the Boar Forest.
Dezi uses this time to study the coin. After a thorough examination, he sees the coin for what it truly is. A magical artifact that once a day, can answer yes/no questions 10 times. Once per day, it can speak and answer a non-binary question.


### A Tavern and a Dwarven Rite
Auri and Thorvinn get drunk. The Dragonborn drinks 8 total flagons of ale in 4 hours, while Thorvinn drinks 13 in a single hour. Auri wakes up with a hangover while Thorvinn does not, because of his Dwarvish tolerance to alcohol and poisons.
![Sunrise Hosted Image](https://github.com/Greiye/greiye.github.io/blob/main/PatWangsDnDCampaign2024/ErubounesuWiki/PatSunrise.png?raw=true) {width:320px,border:"1px solid",border-radius:5px}
{{descriptive

Foursday, Firius 4, 1090

Day 4 of Adventure

Noon

Assadorth Inn

}}

### The Gnome Harness
The new Gnome Harness should be complete by now. Zephyr picks it up from the leatherwork shoppe. 
There’s a commotion in the residential district. The party investigates.
While the party was asleep, two children were taken from their homes in the residential district. The kidnappers used the cover of night to bypass the guards. Much like Keele's kidnapping, there are 2 sets of humanoid tracks that lead from the Northeast as well as the West. Boar forest is in the North. To the West is a jungle/swamp area.

### Feline Conversations 
With newfound power, Welt uses dark magic to talk to a black cat. Welt asks the cat if he saw anyone last night. The cat says that all humans look alike. Aside from that, there were yellow human-like things last night. (Most likely goblins or some kind of variant.)
The black cat named Stevie gestures like a hound dog and points west with his snout.
“Speak to the other side of town. Find a brown cat named Freddy, who guards that side of Assadorth.”
(Someone mention the Golden Dawn Brigade? Who is Captain Rivas? Three injured goblins?)
:::::::

### The Mayor’s Manor
The group go to the Mayor’s Husk’s Manor (That also doubles as a kind of schoolhouse). Sera kicks the door down to Mayor Husk’s abode. The party interrupts the Mayor’s meeting with 5 other people:
![Mayor Husk](https://github.com/Greiye/greiye.github.io/blob/main/PatWangsDnDCampaign2024/images/MayorHusk.png?raw=true) {width:320px,border:"1px solid",border-radius:5px}
This could be the first time they meet Mayor Husk.

### Adventuring Rivals
-A Half Orc
-An Elf with silk purple clothing with instrument on her back
-A Kobold
-Another Elf. Auri can see that she has an arcane focus on her left hilt, exuding mana. Through Mayor Husk, the group discovers that this elf is the local Wizard who lives in the tower. This Elvish woman is Lorellia Vildremant.
-Halfling

Lorellia: “I avoid talking to the common plebeian.”

This could very well be the Golden Dawn Brigade.

###### End of Session 3.
\page


## Session 4

The Kidnappings
22 December, 2023


### The Golden Dawn Brigade
Lorellia calls Dezi ‘a weak imitation of a magic user.’
“You also look like some kind of dragonborn mix with those gray scales behind those bandages.”
Welt quietly emphasizes that ‘Lorellia is a hoe.’
Auri talks to Lorellia. He brings up his people.
L: What happened to your eyes?
A: I lost them long ago.
L: “You lost them in that attack right? How unfortunate. You’re one of them. The Silver Dragonborns.”

The half orc speaks up.
“Krug bored. When fight?”
Lorellia leaves, along with the Golden Dawn Brigade.
By this time, Dezi is sleeping in the baby carrier on Zephyr’s back.

Mayor Husk, a human male, asks the party:
What did you hear or see in Artesh? 
any other relics?

The Group is inspired. (roll inspiration or fate points, house rules.)
### Mayor's Mission: Find the 2nd Child
The group departs from Mayor Husk’s Manor and head West, following humanoid tracks. They are tasked to find the 2 missing children.  One male teenage child with a bowl cut, black hair, about 4’3, likely in black shorts and a shirt and one female, long brown hair, 4’1, also teenager, probably in purple one piece nightwear. 
Auri forms a ‘W’ on each hand and follows the group out, loudly whispering “Wessst Sideeee” to Mayor Husk. While out in Assadorth public, Welt looks for any of the cats. Stevie and Freddy. They are not seen.

### Leaving Assadorth
The group heads out, looking to find the yellow goblins in the Western Jungle.

### The Plains
The treeline of Assadorth tapers off. The group finds themselves in the plains. There, they set camp. With only the occasional shrub, it’s easy to spot any potential threat that comes their way.
Sera catches some rabbits for the night’s meal.

Zephyr is on first watch. Then Thorvinn. Then Auri. Their watch is uneventful.
Morning, Fivesday Firius 5, 1090

### The Western Jungles
The plains disappear and now the group finds themselves at the beginning of the Western Jungle. Along the way, they find an area with giant flowers. Auri and Welt discover that these plants are poisonous. Thorvinn is poisoned, handling some plant samples for Welt. The party gains a poisonous herb. It may be synthesized into a poison. The trail leads past the poisonous flowers, and into a thick jungle area. Zephyr uses his shortsword to cut through the brush, leading the way. The thicket does cut up his skin.
Auri finds 2 more medicinal herbs along the way.

The group sees a chimney of smoke. With Sera’s bardic inspiration,(she yelled monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Over and over again while banging pots and pans), Zephyr climbs up the tall jungle trees and guides the group safely to the source of the smokestack.

### A Camp of Goblins
An orc and a troll seem to be guarding an encampment. The orc is cooking meat over a spit. The troll is sitting closeby.

The group plans their method of attack. Sera and Welt work together to create an illusion of a boar, in hopes that the orc is drawn to it. They are unsuccessful.

With the plan having failed, Zephyr runs in and begins the assault.

\page

### Battle: Goblins
Zephyr punches the troll, only to find that the troll is an illusion. His punch phases past the troll. Thorvinn and Auri follow suit. The two of them focus on the orc. Sera and Welt provide support from the edge of the camp.

After trading blows, 2 yellow goblin warg riders make an appearance from the jungle. Wielding scimitars, they make passing slashes at Zephyr and Auri. A strategic rapier renders a devastating orc battle axe attack mitigated by Auri. What would have been a slash through chainmail became a superficial scratch.

The orc is killed, decapitated by Thorvinn. The goblins and a Warg are killed by Welt via black eldritch blasts that take the form of black penises. 

All throughout the battle, Auri kept falling due to the slippery mud. Thorvinn got tripped by a warg and also fell.
“Fancy meeting you here.” says Auri, when he hears Thorvinn fall down lower, assuming he too lost his footing to the mud.

Zephyr fists a warg right before it meets its end to Thorvinn’s hammer. Zephyr’s arm is elbow deep in blood and feces.

End of battle
Battle Aftermath
Loot
Orcish Greataxe (taken by Thorvinn)
Javelins
Food
Arrows
Auri and Thorvinn each take a tent.

These yellow goblins match the descriptions that the black cat Stevie spoke of. Most likely the ones that took the children.

A short rest. The group investigates the area. The 10 or so tents in the area house no residents; everything is smeared in blood and goblin fluids. Past the camp, an entrance to a cave.

Sera cooks the roasted boar meat that Auri has been keeping fresh this whole time, for the past 2 days. Auri carves a 3x5 inch warg hide from the remains of the wargs. He also takes the orc head, but decides to slice and keep only the ears. It may make for an intimidation tool in the future.

### Troll Illusion
The troll was an illusion. Auri digs at the base. The soil is soft, meaning that it was recently placed in the camp. An illusion rune carved in stone. Welt scratches the rune inscriptions, which disables the illusion.

Finishing a brief rest, the group continues their search for the missing children. They enter the cave. Throughout the entire battle, Dezi was fast asleep in Zephyr’s gnome carrier.
### Delving into the Caves
The cave is dark, dimly lit by glowing mushrooms. The cave is wet, with the occasional sound of a water droplet hitting a pool.
Auri lights a lantern and takes a look; to no avail because he is blind. What he does see, is that the cavern is filled with faint magic; enough to where he can tell where the surfaces are.
Dezi stirs, and wakes up.

Session 4 ends.

\page
## Session 5

### The Caves's Pitfalls and Traps
2024
The group delves deeper into a Goblin encampment, hoping to rescue one of the missing Assadorth children.

7 January
New Rule: 1 minute to discuss before battle

Zephyr tired from battle, witnessing BBC eldritch blasts from Welt
One goblin hit so hard he exploded into a meat mist previously.
Humid.
Disad. Perception changes.
Loose dirt pile. Sera pushes it with harmless tremors. It’s a rune.
### Magical Darkness
We all step out. Past the darkness, we see more loose dirt piles.
Zephyr is in a trance.

Dezi thrown over a loose dirt patch.
Lamp suspended by mage hand goes out.

### Odd Waters
Encounter a waterway

Welt gropes the water. A glyph. Darkness disappears.
Tie Longsword to rope. Use it to see how deep the water is.

Murky Water gets deeper the further the party goes.

Enter a dome room in the cave partially submerged in water. Party passes through it.

Vines  overhead
Hear the crocodile
Auri uses a torch and shape water to reveal the crocs in the water
### Battle: Crocodiles


Auri gets severe damage. Takes a deep breath, focuses on battle (FIghter Second Wind). See the blood staunch.

##### End of Session 5.

\page
## Session 6

### Lost Child in the Caves
Feb 4
The party is in a jungle cave, in the midst of rescuing one of the Assadorth children.



In the room with vines hanging overhead: Goblins begin to move in. Auri and Dezi hear them talking.

Auri exposes himself to speak in Goblin, telling them that his team is an infiltration team, sent by Bahamut. This causes the 3 goblins to further train their arrows on Auri. There is unease. Tension. Anger in the air. Auri shapes water behind him, using ice figurines to inform his party about the 3 goblins archers in front of him.
### The Goblin Boss
"Boss!" one of the 3 goblins calls out.
A larger goblin appears. Goblin Boss as the other goblins refer to him. They say they're looking for the relic as well.

Goblin Boss
"You mentioned higher ups. Which higher ups are you referring to?"

Goblins
"Who goes there? Reveal Yourself!"
### A Conversation with Goblins
Auri
"Oh, here, they gave you a recording on a stone lemme just hand that to yo-ICE KNIFE

### Battle : Goblins
A shard of ice flies out, catching one of the goblins in the neck.
The Goblin boss uses a goblin from behind as a shield effortlessly. A small stack of goblin bodies forms from the Boss's figure, immediately 30 ft down.

Auri kills 3.
Zephyr rushes and punches an archer on the ground vine level.

Dezi sends out a firebolt from his crucible. It burns the goblin boss

Sera tells the grounded goblin archer that he needs to apologize to his momma, which sends him into a catatonic state.

In retaliation, the goblin boss throws a javelin and it kills the one catatonic goblin. There is a hint of regret on the boss's face. He says something along the lines of 'I meant to do that' or 'Let that be a lesson to you.

Goblins Boss says "Kill the Kid.
Queue time constraint for the group to rescue the child.
Zephyr tries to throw Dezi up the 30ft cliff face. Fails. Dezi recovers by doing a cartwheel back to safety. Auri and Welt make 10/10 signs to appreciate Dezi's sudden gymnastic ability.
Auri and Welt make a '10' card signs to signify the great dex save

Story continues right after the group leaves the Western Jungle Caves. The group recover one of the two relics found in the caves. The other relic a glowing blade, was swiftly taken by a Kobold, that the party assumes is from the Golden Dawn Brigade.

- There is mention of the magical coin. One side is believed to be true, up to 10 times per day.
- Dezi Weighs about 49lbs.



Nighttime
### The Teleporting Lady
On the way home to Assadorth, the group encounter a strange, hooded female figure in the night. She stands among the leaves and brush.
Sera: "Hey!"
No response.
Sera: "If you want to fuggin' ignore me that's fine, I guess"
The figure leaves.

Sera: "Psst! Hey! I saw a hooded lady!"
Zephyr: "It was dark, you just saw shadows.
Sera: "I'm telling you I saw something! Are you calling me a liar? Do you think I'm lying?"
Zephyr: "No, I think you're crazy!"

Zephyr rouses everyone up. They spend some time looking for the hooded woman.
To no avail. If there was a woman around, she's gone.

Sunrise
Desi infuses a weapon. (I don't remember who's and with what)

The hooded figure reveals herself.
???: "My name is Tia Lovestrand.


She appears as an Elven woman, with a long ponytail. Her face is covered up with a fabric mask.
Tia: "I ask of you for help. I am by origin, exiled, from an Elven town to the North. I have settled in Assadorth for 10 years, and it is only now that I cannot enter the town.
While I fare decently among nature, It is uncomfortable. 100 yards away from Assadorth's gates, I am transported to my Elven town, a distance away."

Auri asks Tia: "Do you know this child?"
He picks up the saved child from the caves.

Tia:
No, I do not know who this is.
(I'm not sure if she said this.)

All I can remark is... the town of Assadorth is an oddity.

Thorvinn and Co.:
"Will you join us? " to Assadorth. Let's see what happens when you're close to Assadorth gates."

Tia nods.
She follows the group to Assadorth.
When the party is close enough, everyone watches as Tia kneels over, then disappears.

The party is lightly shocked. With nothing else to say to this, they continue on their way to return the child.

Assadorth Guard
"Oh, you found the kid, huh? Good on you. (Or something like that.)

The child simply leaves the party, and straight to his home. (or her?)

### An Afternoon at Mayor Husk's Manor

Dr. Engineer Lady? An NPC?
???:
The Mayor will see you now.
Thorvinn presents the sword from the caves. (I don't remember the reaction to it.)

??? Party:
"Mayor Husk, do you know someone named Tia Lovestrand?"
Husk:
"...No. I don't. Should I?"
??? Party:
"..."

### Husk's Anti-Magic Field
Dezi fixes his glasses to sit properly on the bridge of his nose. This is what the untrained eye sees. In reality, he's just casted detect magic on Mayor Husk's office.
Not a single item shines with mana, not even Dezi's belongings, which are undeniably charged and infused with magical energy.

This means that there is something off with the Mayor's office. A potential anti-magic field. The mayor may or may not be aware of this.

Husk:
"Come back to my office tomorrow. I'll have your reward prepared. Until then, rest easy. You have done the town a service by bringing home one of the missing children. The Golden Dawn Brigade managed to bring home the other child even sooner; just yesterday actually."

"I'll send word to the Red Goblin Inn. You need not worry about the price of lodgings or accomodations. It will be covered by the mayor's purse. Good Day."

The group begins to leave. Auri stops.

Auri:
"Vildremant... she is where?"

Husk:
"Most likely in her tower, as usual."

Auri:
"..."
Auri makes a "W" with both hands.

:
"West sideeeeeeee" (A reference from an earlier session.)
Welts returns, seeing this display of ignorance from the corner of his eye and slaps Auri's hands down. Auri looks at his direction in feigned disapproval.

\page

(A potentially had conversation, I forgot who said what.)

Thorvinn:
"This town truly is odd. The night of the kidnappings, a guard had been injured; another slain. Yet nothing changes."

Zephyr:
"You think they're... letting them get taken?"

Thorvinn:
"Hmm. Hard to say. Maybe that elven woman had a point. Maybe there was something to Assadorth."

Zephyr:
"Oh, the Elven woman with the... "*gestures with his hands that she had large breasts
"Tia Tittykaka. Tia Tamera. Tia Sweet-tits. Something like that."

The Well of Bahamut
Along the way, the group sees another person paying homage to Bahamut by flipping a coin into the well.
(There is talk, I forgot what exactly. I think they said that Bahamut saved the town of Assadorth, according to Mayor Husk?)

The group splits ways for a few moments.


### Talking with Captain Rivas
Auri and Zephyr

Zephyr:
"Let me do the talking."

???
"...Honored to help Assadorth.
I've been in town for about 5 years.

???
"...Vildremants? Tell us what you know."

Captain Rivas:
"Oh, the Vildremant family? They've been in Assadorth for about 10 years now, as wizards.
Lorelia's parents are still alive. "(One parent is an elf and a human, maybe)
They're known for their magic, research, and notable action."

As long as 'you guys' have been around."

(You guys? The captain remembers us. Maybe as the Silver Dragon Guild.)
Auri notices that the captain's gear is  slightly magical.

Auri/Zephyr
What can you tell us of Tia Lovestrand?

Captain Rivas:
"I... have no memory of who that is."

Zephyr's and Auri's Thoughts

Is Assadorth in some kind of magical bubble? Is there an anti-magical field that stems close to Mayor Husk's Manor? Is this a curse? Could the cult be involved?

Someone mentions that Dezi's arm does look like dragon scales.

### Another Visit, The Bahamut Well
The same guy from the other time is still paying homage to Bahamut.
Mentions "Tiamat, the Queen of the Chromatic Dragons", and King Tiamat, the King of Dragons"
"It was king Bahamut that once saved Assadorth from bandits." (Or did Mayor Husk say this?)
The party looks at his reactions. It seems the man genuinely believes that Bahamut saved Assadorth.

The Blacksmith Kane and the sword
Thorvinn, Sera and Dezi

**Thorvinn** <br> 
"I need you to take a look at this sword. We found it in the Western Jungle caves."

Kane <br>
"I'll take a look."

The group meets back up, at the Vildremant Wizard Tower.

### Vildremant Visit, and Brent
Vildremant Wizard Tower
5PM, Some sunlight out.

The same human male servant from before answers the door.

Servant<br>
"... Yes? A visit for Ms. Lorelia Vildremant, I suppose?"

Auri nods.

Servant<br>
"... She is indisposed at the moment. You may wait outside."

Auri<br>
"Wait. Sure a wizard as esteemed as Vildremant has a waiting area for her visitors?"


"No, she does not."

Auri<br>
"Ah. So. You mean to say that your master does not have the resources for a simple room for those that wish to see her?"

"Yes. There is no waiting room."

Auri<br>
"Hmm."

"You may wait here until you are received."

1 hour passes.

"She is still busy. You may continue to wait out here."

Thorvinn<br>
"WHELP. I'm not waiting around for her. I'm headed to the Inn."

Thorvinn leaves to consume copious amounts of meat and ale at the Red Goblin Inn.

Another hour passes.

7PM. Nightfall.

"She is ready to receive you now."

...

As the party heads up, Auri makes small talk.

Auri<br>
"So... servant. What is your name?"

???
"... My name is Brett."

Auri:
"..."

Brett: Vildremant’s Servant from the tower.
....

The party enters Vildremant's study, which from the outside appears to be the 5th or 6th level of the tower.

Although Auri cannot see the area as the others do, he does note that to him, the room is radiantly bright with the sheer magical pressure of tomes and artifacts. The difference is night and day.

\page

### A Talk with a Vildremant
Vildremant appears with her tan brown skin, blonde hair and signature cigarette from her long holder.

Lorelia Vildremant<br>
"Oh. It's you. What do you want?"

Some members of the group ask her questions.

Auri: "Where is the Kobold?"
Vildremant: "...Who?"
Auri: "You know who I'm talking about. The Kobold. He was there, in the Western Jungles caves with us as we saved the child."
Vildremant: "I haven't the slightest who you're talking to."
Auri: "... Both our groups were to work together for the benefit of Assadorth. This is not how you treat your allies."
Vildremant: "We don't need allies. The Golden Dawn Brigade is more than capable of handling these tasks ourselves."

Zephyr<br>
"Tell us more about the cult."

Vildremant:<br>
"Which one? There isn't just one, after all."

Auri<br>
"You won't tell me anything about my tribe, are you?"

Vildremant<br>
"... Information. What I want is information. A trade. You give me what I want, You'll get your information."

Auri<br>
"And what do you want from me?"

Vildremant<br>
 "... Artifacts."

Auri Asks about Tia Lovestrand
Auri: 




The group continues to talks to Vildremant, asking questions.

Vildremant<br>
"There is something you can help me with. "
It's for the Bard of the Brigade. (From a previous session, It's known that she wears a purple silk shirt and has an instrument slung over their shoulder.)

"I need information on... A short sword that bears the image of a fish."

Auri remembers that the short sword that Thorvinn gave to the Blacksmith Kane had an insignia, 'The Singing Fish', written in Infernal. (Translated by Sera, Session 7, Western Jungle Caves).

Auri casts message behind his back to Zephyr
"I know about this. I'll tell you later."

"Ahem."
Vildremant: "You are in the bowels of the Vildremant Tower, surrounded by many an arcane artifacts, in front of Vildremant herself. You think to cast a spell in front of me and presume I wouldn't notice?"

Auri<br>
"We'll have information about this 'singing fish', ready for you by tomorrow. Shall we set up an appointment?"

Vildremant looks annoyed.

Vildremant<br>
"...Not before my meeting with Husk. I assume you'll be there, as well."
"It will have to be then. Have it ready."

The group leaves the tower.

Auri tells the group what he knows.

Auri<br>
"The information that the witch wants, is related to that short sword that Thorvinn recovered. It has a singing fish and some text, inscribed in Infernal. Sera read it out to us."
"That short sword is our one card hand in the game that Vildremant plays. Let's see what she and the mayor have in store for us tomorrow."

#### Inn
The group relax at the inn. Some go right to sleep, some have a meal.

###### The Next Day Firius
### Two Adventuring Parties Meet
The two groups collect in the Mayor's office. It's spacious enough for the 10+ group of people. Among the Golden Dawn Brigade, there is not only Vildremant, but the Kobold that she said she knew nothing of.

Auri sees the Kobold’s mana. He casts the message spell and whispers to him. With the help of Zephyr, he sends a message.

Auri<br>
"The Kobold, he's there?"

Zephyr<br>"No, here, I'm gonna point at him with your middle finger. To the right, yeah- right there."

Auri<br>
"Ah."

"FUCK YOUUUUUUU. You can reply to this message." Auri points angrily with two middle fingers, with the fingers pointed towards the kobold horizontally rather than in the vertical tradition. The Kobold hears him telepathically, but does not reply.

Husk:
"Ah, good, you're all here."
"Let's keep this short. First and foremost, thank you to both teams for promptly returning the children. The Golden Dawn Brigade brought home one of Assadorth's futures, with the other team following suit just a day later.
So. The Relics."

Husk<br>
*reveals a map. <br>
"It seems that the goblin cult, or whoever is taking our children, needs these relics for a ritual of some kind. We know where these relics are."

Husk points to 4 places on the map on his desk. The 4 points have wooden miniatures depicting the area's climate.

"There's a relic in the Volcanic Mountains here, in the Snowy Tundra, the Swamps and the Feylands.

It doesn't matter to us if you two groups work as a team or against each other to recover these artifacts. What's important is keeping the relics away from the hands of bad actors.

The two parties huddle up.

Thorvinn: Okay. Which one are we doing first?
Welt: Auri, aren't you based on cold magic? So you would excel in the tundra.
Sera: I'm not ready to face my family just yet.
Dezi: What do you mean by that, Sera?
Zephyr: What about Feylands?
Welt: My Patron is Fey. I think I'll have an advantage there.
Sera: Let's go to the Feylands.
Auri: I vote for the Feylands as well. That's 3v3.
Zephyr: I vote for Feylands as well.
Thorvinn: Looks like we're going to the Feylands.

Auri reaches into his pocket and brings out a key ring of goblins ears, kept in fresh condition by cold magic. Auri separates a specific goblin ear from the rest.

Auri: "For Dak."(Session 7, the Goblin that was taken captive and killed by the Brigade's Kobold)

Welt: "Oh Gods- throW that awaY alreaDYY"

The Silver Dragon Guild once tasked inexperienced adventurers with rescuing a missing child. Now, they find themselves in a battle against a goblin cult conspiracy.

Assadorth's mayor has sent the adventurers and another local group to retrieve four relics before the goblin cults can use them for their evil rituals. Time is critical as they race against both the cults and their rival party to secure the relics first.

Auri - Vildremant knows where his tribe is. She says she wants artifacts.
Dezi - What’s going on with his gray reptilian disease?
Sera - How is she going to prove herself to her family?
Thorvin - 
Welt - What knowledge is he after?
Zephyr - Where is his father?

### {{color:DarkRed Thorvinn}} Catches Up

The party rests from the previous battle with the tree people and the spiders.<br>

The dwarven paladin **Thorvinn** catches up with the party. He notices that among the party, there’s a kobold dressed as Welt.

### The Human Welt turned Kobold
"Hi." Says the Kobold.

#### The Hunt for the Relic
The party continues toward the Faelands. Somewhere, the relic rests. Using Auri's Magic detection, they track necromantic magic.

#### A Shoddy Hut
Along the way, they encounter a makeshift hut, fit for a single person to reside in. The party peeks through the cabin's shoddy slits between the wood planks.

Completely black.

Auri takes a look. It's all gold-colored mana emenating from the equipment inside.

### Ariella, the Elven Alchemist

![Sunrise Hosted Image](https://github.com/Greiye/greiye.github.io/blob/main/PatWangsDnDCampaign2024/images/Ariella.jpeg?raw=true) {width:320px,border:"1px solid",border-radius:5px}
The group talks with Ariella for a little bit. Zephyr is slightly smitten by her.

### {{color:DarkGray Dezi's Arm}}
Auri brings up Dezi's metal disease. From a distance away, he remembers his infliction. Auri picks Dezu up by the armpits and rushes over to show his exposed are to Ariella.

**Ariella**

" I believe that there is a source of corruption Southeast of here. "

Is this a potential location of relic?

**Ariella**

"I will provide Alchemist Services in exchange for spring water. 

This is a Quest.
Donkeys cared for, for a little bit.
Travel to get water for Ariella as a sidequest. The spring is about 1.5 days out from Ariella’s hut.
Given potions
:
The group leaves.


\page
### Ariella's Springwater Quest
Surrounding area starts looking purple.
Party wakes up in a maze where everything is purple. Purple leaves, grass, etc.


### The Purple Haze
Party event occurs, something about potions.



### The Goblin Wizard and Friend
See a goblin wizard with a pink pointy hat.
Behind the goblin is an overpass. Pass the overpass, a large garden maze.
Someone in the group sees a blur. (The sneaky kobold from before?)


### Auri's Threat

**Goblin Wizard**

"You each must pay 20 gold if you desire to travel past this overpass, into the spring fountains."
:
Auri steps toward the goblin.::
He drops a ring of partially rotten goblin ears to the ground. Auri looks in the general direction of the wizard.::
**Auri**

"... Do you and your friend wish to add to the ring?"
:
**Goblin Wizard**

"...10 gold."

### Pay the Toll
Everyone pays the toll of 10 gold to pass. Only Auri, Zephyr and the donkeys are left.


### Auri's Insult
Auri mocks the goblin by shaping his waterbag’s contents into a smaller Auri, constantly killing the 2 goblins in front of him. This ultimately is the reason for the battle starting. 

**Sera**
"We'll pay you more gold, yes? Just stop this attack on our Dragonborn."

:
**Goblin Wizard:**

“The rest of you are fine. The donkeys are safe as well."

"your Dragonborn, however, will pay for this disrespect *with his life*.”

### The Red Cap
The goblin companion was an illusion. It was actually a Red Cap.

Auri insults the goblins wizard using a frozen deer carcass from his backpack and a slightly rotten ring of goblin ears.



### Battle: Goblin Wizard and Red Cap
Goblin Wizard attacks Auri.

His abs hurt from Tasha’s hideous laughter. 
He gets knocked out several times, his clothes are slightly hacked from Red Cap’s scythe. He has bruises from the Goblin Wizard's metal boots. The rest of the party isn’t too injured. 

The Party is annoyed at Auri. This entire battle could have been avoided.

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Elsire Vale** | The region that Assadorth and Brindol are in. |
| **Assadorth** | A small town where the adventure begins. |
| **The Red Goblin Inn** | Seemingly owned by an older woman in her 40s. She had a conversation with Sera, who was upset by the quality of the food served. |
| **Kane's Smithy** | Owned by the Halfling blacksmith Kane. His daughter Keele, who was first taken by the goblins, has red hair like her father. |
| **The Well of Bahamut** | A place where people toss a coin in every now and again. The waters are refreshing and invigorating. |
| **Church of Selune** | Thorvinn entered here before. |
| **Market District** | Where travelers can find equipment for their travels. |
| **Tanner's Leatherworks** | A leather store, potentially related to the tannery. |
| **Tannery** | A leather tannery. |
| **The Trader** | A trader. |
| **The Wizard's Tower (Vildremante Tower)** | Occupied by Lorelia Vildremante. Her family has been Assadorth's wizard presence for many decades. |
| **The Residential District** | Lacking in security. Two children had been taken in the night. |
| **Mayor's Manor and Schoolhouse** | Mayor Husk's residence. |
| **Brindol** | Not yet visited. The town of Brindol was mentioned at some point. |
| **Western Swamp Jungle** | Has yellow goblins, wargs, and orcs. |
| **Jungle Caves** | Where the 2nd child was found. Inside were strange runes on the floor, crocodiles, and a gelatinous cube. |
| **The Boar Forest** | North of Assadorth. Named for its abundance of wild boars. Medicinal herbs can be found here. |
| **The Plains** | Grassy plains where some goblins can be found. |
| **The Tomb (of Artesh?)** | Seems to have belonged to someone named Artesh. This is where Keele was found. Artesh is involved with goblins or dragons. Inside was some kind of cult, goblins who guarded the outside, and a hobgoblin. The tomb's lower levels have yet to be explored. The main party decided not to chance any further injuries. |

**Silver Dragon Group**
| Characters| Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Auri**  | A Silver Dragonborn Sorcerer. Has long dreads, with many symmetrical horns poking out from it. He wears tribal furs and leathers and carries a rapier on his side. He's blind. Auri was blinded when he was a child, during a violent episode from his past, most likely some kind of raid or war. He wears his Silver Dragon Guild Insignia on a bandage over his eyes. Auri has made it clear that he's joined the Silver Dragons Guild to find his tribe, to once again be with them. He was separated from them in his teenage years. |
| **Dezi**  | A Gnome Artificer. He hails from a place called Ranlean. He carries blacksmithing equipment from which his magic abilities come from. Underneath his bandages, he suffers from some kind of disease that makes his skin appear like metal dragon scales. He's joined the guild to look for a cure. In session 7, he said he weighs about 49 lbs. A strong person could potentially throw him to great heights. |
| **Sera**  | A Red Tiefling Bard. She's noticeably muscular, as much as any man. About 6 ft tall. She wears little clothing. She carries cookwear on her. She's looking to bring honor to her family lineage of cooks. |
| **Thorvinn**  | A Dwarven Cleric. He wears black and red armor. Has a warhammer and shield with the silver dragon's symbol painted on it. He hasn't made clear what his goals are. |
| **Welt**  | A sickly human magic user. He states that his power comes from his deity, a Fey god named Oberon. He's stated to the party that he serves Oberon, a Fey God, and has said that he's collecting magical and medical knowledge. |
| **Zephyr**  | A half-elf monk, judging from his attire. He's on a quest to exact revenge on someone from his past. He's made it clear that any problem can be solved through punches. |
