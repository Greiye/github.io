## Trouble in the Northern Plains
Twosday Firius 2 1090

In Boar Forest
Party wakes at 5am, close to sun up, hungry. Group decides to forage for food (the group goes to get boar; Auri goes fishing).
While hunting for boars, the group meets a couple; both bear the symbol of the Silver Dragon Guild:

Lady Cass takes the form of a beautiful human woman whose clothes are immaculately clean. Her guild symbol is on her necklace. 
Thorvin is a young dwarf paladin man, adorned with a black and red hooded chainmail. In his hands, a warhammer and shield with the guild’s symbol at the front.

Zephyr asks who they are. Upon learning that they are from the guild, Zephyr asks that they help catch breakfast. Welt shares that he is a warlock bound by a contract with Oberon, the king of fairies. His contract binds him so that he must protect the forest unless given certain circumstances (necessity and/or threatened)
Sera takes the boar meat and cooks a meal for the party. Despite the attractive look of the meal, it tastes bad.
The group heads off after spending 3 hours on breakfast.
The Boar Forest begins to taper off into The Plains.

The Plains
The party peek over a hill. At the bottom of the hill are 4 goblins, guarding a ravaged door that leads into the hill. The group splits in two and begin their assault on the goblins.

Battle

The goblins see the party and retaliate. They are quickly dispatched thanks to a sleep and entangle spell. A goblin patrol appears over the hill and continues the assault as soon as the group heads through the door. Past the door is a narrow hallway (5ft. wide) that is pitch black.
In the first room, a fire brassiere. Some people in the group are seeing that this could be some shrine to Selune.
Second room contains 3 goblins. The group handles these goblins while Thorvinn defends the rear from the goblins outside.
Auri gets incapacitated (2 arrows from the patrol team, up on the hill outside)

Healed back to health by Thorvinn.

Zephyr triggers scythe traps
With the goblin patrol eliminated, the group takes a short rest (1 hour).
They enter a small room (6x10 squares?) with pillars and a shrine at the end. There stands 4 goblins, a hobgoblin and a bugbear. The Blacksmith's Daughter, Keele, caged in the furthest corner. The group defeats the enemies with 1 casualty (Auri ofc) (Javelin to the ribcage)

The enemies are looted (longbow, longsword, chainmail, 3 javelins)
Auri slices off goblin ears from the bodies. 16 in total, including the bugbear and the hobgoblin
Covered in blood and mysterious substances, Zephyr violently grabs at the bars of Keele’s cage, ensuring her that she is safe and will soon be taken out of the cage.
Keele is freed by Dezi and examined by Welt. She has no major injuries but is extremely malnourished. She is given rations.

They find a puzzle and a note
"The more you take of me, the less there is"
“Footprints”
Magical footprints lead to the corner of the room. A loose rock switch is discovered. The wall slides up, revealing that the magic footprints leads downstairs .Thorvinn detects undead further down.

Thorvinn discovers a treasure room
Load of coins (
2800 Copper Coins
800 Silver Coins
80 Gold Coins
7 Art Pieces worth 25GP each (Value at 175GP)
A Magic scroll

Someone mentioned that this may be the tomb of Artesh (Welt or Dezi said this)
“Artesh: the Goblin Slayer. Follower of Bahamut.”

Someone mentions something about a human sacrifice at dawn.

A Note written in Goblin found in the area:
Find The Relic.
Do Not Fail Me.



The group decides to head back to town. It's a day and a half trip. Delving down further will have to wait for another day.
