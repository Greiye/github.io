The Story thus far, according to the party:

(This journal entry looks to be written in a kind of primitive braille. There are little boxes that look to have been formed by a talon or claw of some sort, with little dots pressed into the paper.)

We have returned the little one to her parent; The blacksmith known as Kane. With this, the Silver Dragon Guild should be pleased. They will reward us with magic trinkets soon.

I have taken injury from our descent into what the group refers to as ‘The Tomb of Artesh’. Apparently a slayer of goblins. This is not known to my tribe. My people are simple; Ours is knowledge passed down from the elders. We need only know where the water flows, where to gather herbs and where the great beasts migrate to when the ice melts.

My injuries were healed as quickly as they came, thanks to the one that wields the hammer and his companion. The one known as Lady Cass. I am grateful. Along the journey back to the blacksmith, I asked the hammer wielder and the unarmed one, known as Zephyr, how to fight as they do. They have taught me much. Thus, I purchased a weapon known as a ‘rapier’, and armors that befit the warriors of my tribe, made from the dried hide of beasts. I learn quickly. When the familiar sound of a passing arrow comes to my allies, I shall deflect it to the ground, where it shall plant into the soil and sow fruits of failure.

For now, these individuals are my warparty. I rely on them to see what I cannot. The barter must be fair: as much use are they to me, I must be of use to them. 

A repeat of Keele’s taking has occurred during our rest. 2 human wyrmlings have been stolen in the twilight. Clearly for another ritual attempt by the goblinfolk, to appease this ‘Tiamat’. We must find the wyrmlings and return them to the Assadorth townsfolk.

My thoughts circle around the location of my tribe. I tag along, in hopes that the Guild’s many eyes can lead me back into the tribe’s fold. The townsfolk of Assadorth have pointed me to the grand wizard of the tower, Lorellia Vildremant. She has information on them. I rely on her guidance to return me to them.

What is the relationship between these faiths? Selune. Bahamut. Tiamat. What do the goblins hope to achieve with these rituals? Who wrote that Goblin note that Dezi read out to me? Knowledge of this will help us to stop these ritual sacrifices. Such a heroic act will be sure to give our group some renown. I can leverage this. Use this fame to help find my tribe. I must press the wizard Lorellia for what she knows.

…on a side note, I wish to hear more music and taste all the foods that these unfamiliar lands offer. I find that my lack of sight has enhanced my other senses. It would be a shame to adventure forth and not partake in the local treasures. There is magic in the everyday.

(The pages are smudged in a light film of mud.)
The feline did not lead us astray. We followed the tracks deep into the western jungle. We spot a smokestack nearby, as seen by Zephyr, which has led us to an encampment at the mouth of a cave. Before us, an orc and a terrible troll of great size. 
We have returned an orc and his goblin clan back to their god. The troll was not real; an illusion made by magical means.
The goblins were yellow; as the black cat Stevie described. Well, As Welt described it to us. We are closer to finding the wyrmlings back to Assadorth.

I held my own with my new weapon. I managed to protect the one known as Thorvinn from an orcish strike. But it’s not enough. I am used to casting my magicks from a distance where my footing is secure and away from harm.  The wet mud underneath is as challenging as the foes we face.
This rapier confuses me. I am met with new challenges that I embrace like a wyrmling.
These goblins are unlike the ones I know. My clan has traded with goblins before. I have learned their tongue. I have camped inside their caves and shared bread with them. The ones in this region seem a different breed. They seem to relieve themselves right where they sleep and have no concept of cleanliness. Blood and urine soak their fabrics. They reside in tents out in the open, rather than use the stone of the caves as their home. Is it because they are mobile? These tents… did they take them from a human clan?

With a brief exchange, I find that the wizard Vildremant knows something of my clan. She has known since the time I was a child, when I lost my sight. It has been years since I thought of it. I cannot remember how I even lost my ability to see. Only that it is lost.

We delve further into the jungle. Into the caves. We must find the wyrmlings before they are sacrificed towards whatever Gods these cultists pray to.

(Auri does not know that Welts is looking for a cure of some kind. He only knows that he’s out for information, potentially for this ‘Oberon’)

Vildremant woman?

Who is the Kobold Speedster?
Answer: It was some dick from the Golden Dawn Brigade
