The Kidnappings
22 December, 2023

Lorellia calls Dezi ‘a weak imitation of a magic user.’
“You also look like some kind of dragonborn mix with those gray scales behind those bandages.”
Welt quietly emphasizes that ‘Lorellia is a hoe.’
Auri talks to Lorellia. He brings up his people.
L: What happened to your eyes?
A: I lost them long ago.
L: “You lost them in that attack right? How unfortunate. You’re one of them. The Silver Dragonborns.”

The half orc speaks up.
“Krug bored. When fight?”
Lorellia leaves, along with the Golden Dawn Brigade.
By this time, Dezi is sleeping in the baby carrier on Zephyr’s back.

Mayor Husk, a human male, asks the party:
What did you hear or see in Artesh? 
any other relics?

The Group is inspired. (roll inspiration or fate points, house rules.)

The group departs from Mayor Husk’s Manor and head West, following humanoid tracks. They are tasked to find the 2 missing children.  One male teenage child with a bowl cut, black hair, about 4’3, likely in black shorts and a shirt and one female, long brown hair, 4’1, also teenager, probably in purple one piece nightwear. 
Auri forms a ‘W’ on each hand and follows the group out, loudly whispering “Wessst Sideeee” to Mayor Husk. While out in Assadorth public, Welt looks for any of the cats. Stevie and Freddy. They are not seen.

Leaving Assadorth
The group heads out, looking to find the yellow goblins in the Western Jungle.

The Plains
The treeline of Assadorth tapers off. The group finds themselves in the plains. There, they set camp. With only the occasional shrub, it’s easy to spot any potential threat that comes their way.
Sera catches some rabbits for the night’s meal.

Zephyr is on first watch. Then Thorvinn. Then Auri. Their watch is uneventful.
Morning, Fivesday Firius 5, 1090
The Western Jungle
The plains disappear and now the group finds themselves at the beginning of the Western Jungle. Along the way, they find an area with giant flowers. Auri and Welt discover that these plants are poisonous. Thorvinn is poisoned, handling some plant samples for Welt. The party gains a poisonous herb. It may be synthesized into a poison. The trail leads past the poisonous flowers, and into a thick jungle area. Zephyr uses his shortsword to cut through the brush, leading the way. The thicket does cut up his skin.
Auri finds 2 more medicinal herbs along the way.

The group sees a chimney of smoke. With Sera’s bardic inspiration,(she yelled monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Over and over again while banging pots and pans), Zephyr climbs up the tall jungle trees and guides the group safely to the source of the smokestack.

An orc and a troll seem to be guarding an encampment. The orc is cooking meat over a spit. The troll is sitting closeby.

The group plans their method of attack. Sera and Welt work together to create an illusion of a boar, in hopes that the orc is drawn to it. They are unsuccessful.

With the plan having failed, Zephyr runs in and begins the assault.

BATTLE
Zephyr punches the troll, only to find that the troll is an illusion. His punch phases past the troll. Thorvinn and Auri follow suit. The two of them focus on the orc. Sera and Welt provide support from the edge of the camp.

After trading blows, 2 yellow goblin warg riders make an appearance from the jungle. Wielding scimitars, they make passing slashes at Zephyr and Auri. A strategic rapier renders a devastating orc battle axe attack mitigated by Auri. What would have been a slash through chainmail became a superficial scratch.

The orc is killed, decapitated by Thorvinn. The goblins and a Warg are killed by Welt via black eldritch blasts that take the form of black penises. 

All throughout the battle, Auri kept falling due to the slippery mud. Thorvinn got tripped by a warg and also fell.
“Fancy meeting you here.” says Auri, when he hears Thorvinn fall down lower, assuming he too lost his footing to the mud.

Zephyr fists a warg right before it meets its end to Thorvinn’s hammer. Zephyr’s arm is elbow deep in blood and feces.

Arrows
Auri and Thorvinn each take a tent.

These yellow goblins match the descriptions that the black cat Stevie spoke of. Most likely the ones that took the children.

A short rest. The group investigates the area. The 10 or so tents in the area house no residents; everything is smeared in blood and goblin fluids. Past the camp, an entrance to a cave.

Sera cooks the roasted boar meat that Auri has been keeping fresh this whole time, for the past 2 days. Auri carves a 3x5 inch warg hide from the remains of the wargs. He also takes the orc head, but decides to slice and keep only the ears. It may make for an intimidation tool in the future.

The troll was an illusion. Auri digs at the base. The soil is soft, meaning that it was recently placed in the camp. An illusion rune carved in stone. Welt scratches the rune inscriptions, which disables the illusion.

Finishing a brief rest, the group continues their search for the missing children. They enter the cave. Throughout the entire battle, Dezi was fast asleep in Zephyr’s gnome carrier.
The Caves
The cave is dark, dimly lit by glowing mushrooms. The cave is wet, with the occasional sound of a water droplet hitting a pool.
Auri lights a lantern and takes a look; to no avail because he is blind. What he does see, is that the cavern is filled with faint magic; enough to where he can tell where the surfaces are.
Dezi stirs, and wakes up.
