In the past year I became a professional genealogist. I have been searching for information on my father's side of the family for the past 20 years and finally did something about it. I have many holes and little by little I do my best. I run into a lot of problems... mostly with relatives who don't speak english, lots of them don't know, a few that don't want to tell me and yet I figure it out and then they want me to tell them. I only help the people who help me. Those are the people who want to know where we are from. I have my direct cousins In Mantalongon, Cebu now. They are older and don't remember much. I have 2nd cousins and 3rd cousins who tell me as much as they can. Victor Empleo are my father;s direct cousins that fall under the parents being brothers. Right now I have over 23k Empleos and their relatives that are related. So.... let's start with your parents, aunts, uncles and do you have any brothers and sisters. Like I said, little by little I will find out. I have access to Philippine births, deaths, and marriages. I have other access too. The only thing is that I get side tracked because I have other cousins that want the information but don't want to tell me anything...so I have to weed them out and go on to the next. Let me know. Thanks

Well, let's see..... What I have is Victor married two times.  His second wife was Felifa Ybanez. They had about 8 children.  His first wife had about 5 children.

Now out of all those kids... Melecio Ybanez Empleo married Clotilde Abregana on 11/30/1955 in Cotabato, Maguindanao.  I am assuming they had children which I haven't gotten to yet....which means this would have been your mother? and married a person named ??? Go??? then you are a product of them.  Your parents fit into my timeline and family trees...which would explain how you and I are related.  My father Florentino changed his name to Tony Empleo born in Carcar...but raised in Mantalongon, Cebu.  Victor lived around the corner growing up.  My father and Victor are 2nd cousins.  Victor's father Ciriaco E. Empleo(born in Barili) and my father are 1st cousins once removed.

Yes there are 5 Victor Empleo in my family tree so far.  Back then, it looked like they had no other names.  You should see how many Francisco's and Jose's there are.  Thank god back then, they named their children middle names with the wife's/mother's maiden name.

What gets more confusing is that sometimes the husband, when they marry their wife..... they take the wife's maiden name as their last name.  Gotta remember before 1849 there were no last names.  They used the village's priest name as their last name.  Yep it gets more confusing.  Finding out that cousins married cousins too.  Husbands had many wives and many children and pretty much named them all the same name and in mid stream they would use another name.

So...with all that said...who are your parents' names?  I am assuming your father's parents are from China

Do you talk to any of your cousins in Mantalongon, Cebu?  We have a cousin Diane or even Nelson Empleo.  He knows most of the cousins there?

Messed Up.
March 21 2024.
Went from 162 people to 138.
Duplicates? I lost some family information.
There's 2 files. The first folder had 162 people, but went up to 298 becuase I imported over. The import did not overwrite.


Rena Empleo is my 3rd Cousin, from 2nd Great Grandparents.
