# Plan:  
  
Recap with Tobias; a flashback.  
  
They've taken the safe roads. Every hour, they pass wooden towers with catfolk manning the sentries. They pass by caravans of war supplies and material. It's mostly catfolk.  
  
Tobias is talking about the crew, highlighting their unique qualities.  
(All Roll for the Negative/Positive)  
  
His reason:  
When I was young, I was saved by a Church of the First Deacon. He has a small child with him. Kid kept talking about his orc best friend. Purdue? or what it The Sapphire Peak? I don't know. forgot in my old age.  
  
Long ago I used to be an adventurer myself. Part of a group, tasked by royalty to do odd jobs. now these royalty, even by gnomish standards, were quite short. We called them the short kings. And I was part of the short kings elite task force. It's why I know that adventurers are the way to go. such talent. such potential! You don't get that every day, and you'd have to be an absolute phenomenon to survive in these lands.  
  
  
Anyway, my party died. We fell to the House of Basalt. All women. Before they could off me and friend, A white light blasted the executioner. Church of the First, they're good people.  
  
Used my potential to do what I could for them after that. cleaned up. Got married. had kids. spending my money to do what I can for Ein, their one winged god.  
  
## For whoever took the mother  
I saw what you did with the mother. You moved first. The other guy did nothing. So i'll tell you:  
This relic is an artifact that will bring back the God Ein. I've spend decades looking for it, the least I can do for all the Church has done. I'll give it to the church.  
  
It's worth a lot of money. The House of Basalt women will literally KILL for this.  
  
I know you're good souls. I'm telling you this just in case.  
  
[Performance roll for Clive, see if he heard or pretended to sleep.]  
  
  
  
I knew hiring all of y'all was the best move.  
  
  
Nighttime. 40F Cold with a light breeze.  
  
  
  
[Kraven can turn into a horse, so the party can ride.]  
  
## What now?  
Tobias is dead. Cart is tipped. Party says to stick together until the job is done.  
  
  
## A talk with Silvanus  
  
## Short Rest?  
What's the reason? What's the time limit?  
  
  
## The Mother  
The mother returns with a soldiers. Her head is wrapped. She points to Sha'kill and says that he's part of the invasion force. The soldiers question them.  
  
  
What does the party do?  
They go to the shrine.  
  
## The Fellow Goliath  
Talk to Jason in Tagalog. Goliaths can help. at least, up until they get the relic. House of Basalt will pay handsomely. It will fuel their war machine.  
  
Talk:  
Goliaths, goblins and orc in the camp. they have carts of oil distant from  
  
  
## Runes  
  
Inside are ancient runes that Sha'kill can activate. They are activated by large mana figures that can be held in hand. Large baskets eject overhead. They activate clerical spells.  
  
Battle is 5v5.  
  
Relic is 'the sacred flame.' It's an unending flame in a small brassiere.  
  
An NPC survives.  
  
Endings  
  
## Good Endings  
- Kraven returns the relic to Ms. Tenderfoot. Her lavish home represents the Tenderfoot Wealth. She spends some time and organizes for some money to make santuaries. Kraven enjoys this, An oak leaf finds its way to his hand.  
  
- The Church of the first sings Sha'kills praises, soon he is approached by countless adventures for challenges only he is capable of.  
  
- Clive collects his money. No one hears from him again.  
  
## Bad Ending/Death  
- Silvanus weeps for Kraven. Occasionally, Clive and Sha'kill are visited by parrots and oak leaves in the distance.  
  
- Sha'kills giant bones are used for goblin weapons. Worse than death, there is no glory for the forgotten.  
  
- Clive's body is eaten by the wandering beasts of the forest. His bow is collected by wandering elves.
