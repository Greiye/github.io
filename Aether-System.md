### Overview

The Aether System is a closed mana/magic ecosystem in which 100 points circulate throughout the world, ensuring that nothing is gained or lost but rather transmuted into different forms. This system is the foundation of a unique magical world where materials, entities, and constructs interact in a perpetual cycle of energy and transformation.

### Materials/Elements

Materials are the base units of the system, corresponding to the elements of the real-world periodic table, totaling 118. Each material is imbued with mana, the vital force that allows transmutation and the manipulation of the aether points.

### Entities/Pantheons

Entities, ranging from minor spirits to powerful gods, are born from the combination of materials and mana. They exist on different levels, each with distinct capabilities and limitations.

### Races

Races are born from entities and pantheons, inheriting traits from their progenitors. They use the materials and mana to shape their societies and environments.

### Structures

Structures are created by races and entities using materials. They serve as focal points of power, habitation, and worship.

### Portals

Portals are gateways created by entities desiring their own dimensions. They are temporary and can only transport a limited number of items before dissipating.

### Artifacts

Artifacts are objects of power, defined by their aether levels. They serve various purposes, from mundane tools to legendary weapons, each reflecting the strength and intent of their creators.
