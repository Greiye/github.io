Simple, but complex.
Complex things are hooked up to API's. So it's as simple as you want it to be.
Can be played on mobile.
All my close friends can play it.
Family API. The one with all our family member's stories.

Preferrably smallest size possible.
3D background, 2d Sprites.

Whatever we do in this game, is solidified in our group's fiction works.

No direct inserts from another lore.
Point of sharing the same fictional universe is respecting other's genuine desire to tell their unique story.

Otherwise you have a character who is based off their mother getting killed by sonic the hedgehog, who is severus snape's mother.

Based off of real world events, but not actually real world events.

Attention to culture. Clothing, architecture, food and traditions.

## Say the game is done, what then?
I hope to enjoy it when I'm 80 and immobile.
Use it to relive my younger days.
