February Week 5 Notes

26 Feb Notes

Huh. This is interesting. 

I like this.

Okay. So.
I guess writing in HTMl isn't too efficient.
Keep to txt then. With text in raw form, I have more developer ability with it. Send to several sites.

<a> is anchor. Anchor.

href, What is that?
Just means hypertext reference.


URL Schemes
File
File Transfer Protocol
Mailto

I feel that mailto is outdated. No one really has an email open up at the ready.
...Unless... that's what I'm not doing?
Maybe I should be reaching out to more people online.

Relative URLs
Link files on the same site

ohhhh you can just use "../../index.html" as a valid hyperlink. wow.

an HTML ID attribute creates a fragment identifier (Could look like 1G3K6H or ComputerScience#Historic).
Cool.



ahhhhhhhh So. I can title a section using header (h2) and give it an id.
id="Chapter1".

with the id set, I can anchor with a hyperlink reference. <a href="Chapter1> Chapter. </a>

Using photos is a graphical hyperlink.
<img src="dog.jpg" alt="pupper."></a>

target attribute.
self attribute will take the user to the new site, in the same tab/window.
blank will be 'blank slate.' It'll take the user to a new tab/window.
Most browsers will open a tab nowadays with a blank target.

target="_blank" is what a target attribute is gonna look like.

Man. I would not have extrapolated that target means 'open in the same or new window'. just from the tag 'Target'.

Special Characters
Entities

Wireframe Planning

Labs
More like challenges.

Make an assymetrical table.

Make a site that has downloadable files. Hmm.

Containers.

header
footer
address (for contact)
main document's primary content
section chapters
article (news articles)
nav (navigation)
aside (stuff not directly related to main)
div block Containers
span (in line containers)

I would assume that span would go into a div.

FORMS

this is what I want.


A Form is just data to server from user.

action attribuite is encrypted.

Form data goes right to database.

so. If you're using <form>, you have to use action. the URL where the data will be sent.
then there's the method. the POST.
POST sends an HTTP request.

escaped form data
can be a thing of transfiguration. + is now a space.


Feb 28.
One last day until March.
Gotta get ready for that.

Usual Widgets
Buttons

Notes End on March 1.

Password Field is a widget

Audio and Video Element

Structured Query Language

Audio Types I'll probably encounter

AAC (Advanced Audio Encoding)
Supposed to be MP3 Successor.
OGG. Ogg Vorbis. Open Source Audio Encoding.
.WAV is Microsoft IBM. Meant for storing uncompressed audio.


Coder , Decoder. Codec. Wow.
H.264 is widely available.
H.265 Supports 8k Resolution.
