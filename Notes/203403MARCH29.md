I should do home no weight workouts. Take what I learned from the GYM.

I should go fishing with Mr. Bayite.

Software Capstone? What's it about? I gotta plan for that.
4:52AM.

#### Skincare
Micellar Water with Hyaluronic Acid

#### How I used my time while studying:
I feels like I used it poorly.
It must feel this way because I didn't stick to my goals.
On the occasion that I did make a goal, I'd forget about it. What I could've done weeks ago, I didn't.


### Motherly Expectations
I can read it like a book. Mom's gonna go into the kitchen and start her daily routine. She's gonna make a lot of weird noises, which is common for her back at the farm. It's a lot of silly noises. These noises irritate me. So do the dogs constantly barking.

I should take them out for more walks.

The noises are going to irritate me. I prefer quiet. If not quiet, then at least subtle noises that have value. I can't take valueless talk. It's annoying. Might as well just make random noises like some kind of babboon.

After the noises, mom will want to talk to me about random topics. I've done this before as a test. rapidly change topics. And you know what? Mom doesn't notice. She'll just keep talking and talking, saying nothing.
