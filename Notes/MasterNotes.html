    <p>I gotta organize all these notes. Put them into a database.</p>
    <h2>2024 March 24 </h2>
    <p>Woke up at broski's late. 11AM?
        <br>Hung out. Told them about last night. Ace and Joel and all that. We'll all probably have to hang with them. sooner or later.
        <br>Noticed just how spoiled Liv can be sometimes. I won't tell her what she wants to hear, so she shoots back and tries to manipulate me through her words. It's a constant battle with her. I kind of like it, actually. It's verbal sparring. A game of chess that most women speak.
        <br>It does make me question her, though. It makes me question her respect for me. Her respect for my brother. I am reminded of an ex of mine, Christine. She was conniving.
        <br>I think of all the good she's done for me, though. And what she's done for others. She's not a bad person. She's just, in her worst of times, selfish. She wants certain things her way. Sometimes she forgets the impact that she had in whatever she wanted previously. What's important to her is being in control, or in a powerful position. Being always right and never wrong.

    <p>Helped with housework. Helped with the 3D Printing. Gave kuya blogging material.</p>
    <p>Tried coding through codespace. It was possible, but not effective. I found that my tablet and keyboard wasn't good. The keyboard kept being late by one character. It was irritating.</p>
