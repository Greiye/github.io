2024 March 26
Woke up late
went to gym
closer and closer to 27th.
Thought I'd have something for Rena (pronounced Ren'e)
Mom seemed good to talk with her. They talked for a while.
Gym notes
Worked out most muscle groups.
Shoulders are stronger. Doing 60lbs with no issue.
I want to be able to lift my own weight. So 170? About 90lbs each shoulder?
Wonder how my body will look like when it gets to that point.
Got home.
Immediately got overwhelmed


>It sounds like you're experiencing frustration with the dynamic between you and your mother. From what you've described, it seems like there's a mismatch in communication styles and priorities between you two.

>Your mother, being 65 years old, may be seeking companionship and connection through conversation, even if it seems like "nonsense" to you. As people age, their social circles may shrink, and they may rely more on family members for interaction and support.

>On the other hand, you're 29 years old and focused on your studies and financial stability. Your time and energy are valuable resources, and you prioritize tasks and conversations that contribute to your goals.

>This situation reflects a common generational and life stage difference. Your mother may be seeking emotional fulfillment and companionship through conversation, while you prioritize efficiency and goal-oriented activities.

>It's essential to recognize and respect each other's needs and boundaries. While you may not be interested in engaging in "nonsense" conversation, acknowledging your mother's need for connection and finding a balance that works for both of you is crucial.

>Communication is key. Express your priorities and boundaries to your mother in a respectful manner. Set aside dedicated times for focused study and work, but also allocate some time for casual conversation with her if you can. Additionally, consider seeking support from other sources, such as friends or support groups, to alleviate some of the pressure on you to fulfill all of your mother's conversational needs.

>Ultimately, finding a compromise that respects both your needs and your mother's desires for companionship is essential for maintaining a healthy relationship.

ChatGPT understands the situation completely.

I'm not stopping for the nonsense my mother has to tell me. I won't be the ear to listen to her while the house falls apart.


## Where to go from here
Truth is, mom no longer communicates well with me. Different life stage.
I don't really sense any desire from her to understand me. I've learned American values that she'll never understand.

I wonder if this is us growing apart now. You can't help it.

## one of many ways to see demand for Software Engineering Jobs
Software industry is here to stay and with loads of jobs in coming decade for sure.

But you need to know latest technologies to be job relevant.

I suggest one simple task

    Goto all top VC firms in US e.g. Sequoia Capital and checkout jobs page on their website

Here you will find all the startups ( they have invested ) jobs and jobs description.

    Do this exercise for all the top 10 VC and you know how much demand is there for jobs.

atm AI / ML jobs are in pretty high demand and highest paid as well. This is just like Java developer in huge demand during 1990, I heard stories ( from India ) that anyone who could spell “J A V A” ( over telephonic interview ) could able to get H1B. LOL good old days sigh

Do checkout AI & Robotics | Tesla 62, if you wish get back into electronics.
