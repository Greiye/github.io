    <h1>This is a future projections page.</h1>
    <p>For example, in 2024, there's all this buzz of AI (Or Large Language Models)
        <br>I already told kuya Rev that all this AI will be used by incompetent people, which will negatively affect the talent pool.
        <br>For example. Hiring HR Agents only spend up to 6 seconds reviewing an interviewee's resume. Which is completely unfair.
        <br>What they're looking for is keywords, without really understanding the implementation of the keyword. they'll see 'CEO' of a company, and think overqualified, but really it was a title they gave themselves.
        <br>Use of AI will hopefully replace them if they're doing such rudimentary work. But now there's the problem of the LLM's filter being set by someone just as incompetent.
        <br> So. How can one remedy this? When will it be remedied on a large scale? What is the perfect time for someone to capitalize the most on the eventual corruption of LLMs?

    </p>
    <h2>Software Engineering Demand</h2>
    <p>What companies will be hiring en masse for software engineers?
        <br>This is relevant for someone like me. Capitalize on that time.
        <br>These companies are machines. They don't care who I am. They're faceless machine overlords who were made by some greedy human fuck who only made it for the money. That means that when I'm interviewing, i'm not being interviewed by a human person, I'm being interviewed by the logic of a human filter. They don't care about me. It's an emotionless transaction. I need money and can provide a service. They're looking for service and will give little money to improve their efficiency. That's fine, this is my machine versus theirs.
    </p>
    <h2>With all the focus on the perfect machine, there's the subtext of the perfect human.</h2>
    <p>In this moment in time, there's so much attention to machine efficiency, that the demand for 'human interaction and way of life', on Humanity will also increase.
        <br> I heard about this on a ted talk.
