WOrks with transparency. Adds noise.

Darken.
Hides brighter colors.
Doesn't change the hue, really just hides the white value.


Multiply
Hides White that is 100% white.
Keeps black 100% black.

Color burn
alters 100% white.

Been looking at obituaries a lot. People who are about as old as me. Younger. Passed away.
Also been thinking about how I have more money than a lot of the world.
THen how some of the richest people are the least happy.
It's all about perspective.

Tried to code for a little bit. got some stuff done.
