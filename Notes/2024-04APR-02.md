Went to gym.

Went to gym the other day too.


Now I'm looking at blend modes.

# Blend Modes
Normal
You know it.

Dissolve
Not on Aseprite.
WOrks with transparency. Adds noise.

Darken.
Hides brighter colors.
Doesn't change the hue, really just hides the white value.


Multiply
Hides White that is 100% white.
Keeps black 100% black.

Color burn
alters 100% white.
