<h3>Tabletop Hybrid Project</h3>
<p>Now that I know how to code a little bit, I can see my Tabletop Dream being a reality.</p>
<p>Should I spend so much time playing this game?</p>
<p>It's like jackbox. all devices connect to a database. For DnD Purposes, It'll be more lightweight. It will be just the stat data and all that. </p>
<p>Why am I even bothering with DnD? Shouldn't I be focusing in real life?
    <br>I'm gonna use it as a creativity outlet. Creativity is just another type of intelligence, anyhow.
    <br>It will also be for testing problems and solving them with the squad.
    <br>Like for example: I have a computation or PC problem. I'll throw it the group's way, see if they see it in a different light.
    <br> Minigames is also cool. Something as simple as a rubber band shooting paper through holes. Gold will be the cost of it.
</p>
<p>DnD Idea: I won't stand for inefficiency. A story about a robot sentient who's trying to get rid of the organic parts of his business.</p>
