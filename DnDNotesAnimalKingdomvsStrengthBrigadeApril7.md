Tobias Tenderfoot, a Gnome Aristocrat hires his 'elite team';

    Clive (Pat) - A Human (Variant?) Gloomstalker who's taken on a contract with Tobias. They met at a tavern. Tobias says he knows who Clive is.
    Sha'kill (Jason) - A Goliath Rune Knight, who seeks glory. He was found by Tobias and Clive while arm wrestling a large, muscular human.
        Sha'kill dislikes Clive, potentially loathes him. during their week together, Clive's aloof nature brought him the well received attention of many villagers and fair maidens, making Sha'kill look like he was 'trying too hard.'
        Clive ended up liking the benefits of having a looming giant in your group. A Goliath parts crowds with their mere presence.
    Kraven (Geffery) - An Aarakocra Druid, who looks to travel the lands and do good in Silvanus's name. Tobias picked him up to join the group, promising Kraven sanctuaries of trees and flowers in Silvanus' name. 
        Kraven also liked the imposing presence of a 7 foot giant warrior. It made enforcing the protection of nature much easier.
        Clive found Kraven to be just another pawn, to be used until no longer needed.
        Kraven found Clive to be standoffish, his preference to privacy something to be wary off.
        Sha'kill found the Aarakroca to be annoying in his pursuit to please some invisible god.


Note:
Sha'kill doesn't seem to know what gold coins are, much less their use in settlements.
Kraven resembles a parrot.
Kraven worships Silvanus, whose deistic domain lies in nature.

Roughly a week passes in between each new hire.

Tobias Tenderfoot:
"Now this, is a team", says Tobias. "One with the arrows, one for up close conversations, and one for old magic."
He shows them a map and a large key. The key is a foot long, made of gold. It has a ring as a handle, with 6 wings extending from from the ring's center. The center houses a blue gem. Tobias flicks the gem, causing it to flash an iridescent light.
The light wanes and dies to a flicker.

(Tobias has an Irish accent)
"Finally, I have all I need. Years of earning all that gold, making allies throughout the region, assembling a vanguard for the 'just in case'. I'm ready to find one of the Shrines of the First. In there, a relic. When I find it, you'll all get what's agreed upon. Clive, you get the gold. Sha'kill, The glory of it. I'll be singing your praises to my last days. Kraven, sanctuaries for Silvanus."

He opens the map. It's written in Gnomish.
"The last recorded location is just a week's time away from here, deep in the forest. We're gonna have to cut through these towns, starting from our current location. Get some rest.  We'll need it."

The Quest
--------------
Help Tobias obtain the relic from the Shrine of the First.
The party travels in Tobias' Carriage. It's rather small, but normal size for a Gnome. It's being pulled by a common draft horse, has space for 2 people at the front and 3 people in the back with the supplies accounted for. Sha'kill takes the front carriage seat next to Tobias. The whole carriage leans to the right.

3 days pass.
The group arrives in the town of Felidae, and have to make a decision. An Southeastern invasion force is making their way to the Northwest. They can either Take the Toll Roads, which is safer but far more expensive due to the invasion force, or Take the Mountain Path, which is usually more dangerous due to the local fauna. The group decide on the toll roads. Tobias notes this.

3 days pass.
The following town of 500 people has been razed. Stacks of smoke and fire engulf the settlement. The thought of the invasion force passes through the party.
An older, portly woman holding a baby is covered in soot. She says nothing, staring at the party as their carriage passes. "I-ah, mmm, I don't...", Tobias is at a loss for words. The party has a chance to act on this. Sha'kill says 'I have a soft spot for this', gets off and ushers the pair aboard. 

Clive doesn't bother getting out when hearing about the mother and child. Tobias notes this.

2 days pass.
Sunset.
The mother and child are apathetic. They eat and drink when given water and rations but throughout the 2 days, they remain quiet.
Tobias is struggling to drive the carriage while reading the map. "I know it's around here somewhere, we're so close, this damn map... Sha'kill, take a look." Sha'kill takes it and immediately hands it to Kraven to read. Kraven can't make sense of it. He hands it back to the Goliath.

Down the road, just in time, Sha'kill see it. A 5 foot drop, dug in the middle of the road. Tobias doesn't see it. Sha'kill acts fast.
He gets off the carriage and heroically slows it down, his heels digging into the soft road. A branch, a loose stone, something, knocks Sha'kill off balance. He falls and is dragged under the carriage.

The carriage tips on its side as it falls down the drop. Everyone is injured. Tobias gets up, nursing what looks to be a dislocated arm. He's disoriented, panicking. Clive, Kraven and Sha'kill are banged up, their bodies making sudden contact with the carriage frame. The mother has a gash across the left side of her head. The child, still wrapped in the blanket flew 8 feet away, stationary and silent. The mother runs to her child.

Looking around, Clive and Sha'kill see the telltale signs of a trap. The drop looks to have taken 2 days to dig up. Kraven notes the animal tracks. pawprints bearing the long lines of claws in the dirt.

"I, wha-, oh no, the carriage. What did-." Tobias is calmed by The Aarakocran. "Hey, it's okay, we're fine."
"This was a trap." says Clive.
"A tra - what do you-" Before Tobias can finish, 2 arrows fly and pierce the carriage canvas.
The group is under attack.

## The Battle
"WE'RE UNDER ATTACK" roars Sha'kill. "Southeast!" The party takes cover behind the many roadside trees. The mother is motionless as she lays on her knees clutching her child, uncaring of the events around her. Tobias runs to the other side of the fighters, taking cover behind the trees.

Kraven blindly casts a spell, engulfing an area in long vines with giant, razorsharp thorns. More arrows from the deep dark forest sail through the air, but hit only bark. Clive, thinking himself safe in cover, sees another arrow fly through the air from the other roadside. Their attackers seem to have surrounded them.

Kraven and Sha'kill identify their enemy. In Kraven's field of thorns, a lone goblin with unnaturally broad shoulders holds a shortbow. The vines have wrapped around his legs, making superficial cuts on the goblinkin's skin. Sha'kill holds back from entering the thorn field; he's aware and has seen the damage Kraven's thorns are capable of.

Clive hears a familar scream. Tobia's voice. Clive rushes to Tobias' cries, only to see a giant wolf and an emeciated goblin rider, thrashing something from left to right. Likely Tobias.

An unnatural mighty winds blow through the leaves of every tree and shrub, originating from Kraven's colorful feathers. The goblin holds steadfast onto a low branch.
The field of thorns grow yellow and brittle, the wide goblin looks down in surprise. looking up, Sha'kill is towering over him. The green goblin makes a horrified expression. A loud gasp escaped his crusty lips. Sha'kill picks the goblin up by the feet, jumps up and **slam dunks** the goblin 10 feet into the trees. The goblin's head catches on 2 forking branches, his neck disconnecting and stretching down as Sha'kill pulls him down with all his weight. The goblin gurgles blood, then hangs from the tree, swaying with the remnants of Kraven's wind magic.

The wolf beast is done shaking the creature and throws it into a tree with great force. Clive sees it was Tobias.

The emaciated rider signals the beast with a kick to the ribs.  the pair rush to the fallen draft horse, an arrow is nocked on a shortbow. They fail to notice the Gloomstalker Clive, taking cover behind a nearby tree behind them. The goblin rider looses an arrow at Kraven, but only meets dirt.

Another arrow looses. Clive's arrow pierces through the wolf, the sharp tip poking clean through out the other side of the wolf's ribcage. A shrill bark fills the air. Clive notes the familiar wounds on the beast's legs and the red stained fur; seems the creature was affected by Kraven's thorn field. 

Suddenly, the air around the wolf and rider pair begins to spark and ignite. A wide beam of light slowly waxes above them from the clouds overhead. 

Sha'kill rushes through the trees towards Tobias' screams, battle adrenaline coursing through his veins. Along the way, he sees the column of magical light forming overhead through the gaps of the trees. When he arrive out of breathe by Kraven's side, the column of light flashes, bringing down an unseen force down the wolf and rider. Before Kraven's glowing eyes, the destruction only Silvanus is capable of. The wolf is forced to the ground, the magical light melts the beast, leaving only brittle bones bleached with celestial magic. In the chaos the wolf rider was blasted off, his goblin skin cracking like dry mud in the wastelands from Silvanus's light. Wasting no time, the goblin makes a run to safety, and away from the fight they started.

Clive nocks another arrow, the tip trained on the fleeing goblin. In between the trees, a clear shot. He times it well. a slow breathe. Waiting for the right time. The time arrives. He relaxes his right hand fingers and lets the bowstring straighten. In slow motion, the arrow flies through the tree leaves and finds purchase on the nape of the goblin's neck. The stick-thin, headless goblin continues to run as if it wasn't just beheaded. 3 seconds later, it crashes into a tree then lays motionless

### End of Combat
Clive rushes over to Tobias. The wolf attack left him in bad shape. The carriage crash dislocated his arm, but the wolf had broken his legs and a hand. His ripped clothes revealing deep gashes and lacerations all over his frail Gnome body.

With a weak voice, he quickly tells Clive what to do to claim his compensation.
"This town, you've been there yes? Find my love, Ms. Tenderfoot. A cottage in the grove, in the East. Tell her this, ***exactly*** this... 'It seems my luck's run out, angel.'"
He hands Clive the map and the golden key.
"Bring her what you find... in the Shrine of the First."
He takes his last breathe.

Immediately Sha'kill loots Tobias' body and finds 15 Gold pieces. 

The group looks around. The cart is broken and splintered into pieces. The mother and child are nowhere to be seen. The draft horse is standing, still anchored to the carriage's harness. There are goblin bodies in the woods. 

"...I want the reward. I'll have to collect this relic and take it to Ms. Tenderfoot." Says Clive.
"I just want glory." Says Sha'kill.
"Someone must answer for this destruction", says Kraven.

The quest for the relic continues.

---------------------
Session 2 of the Twoshot

Making a dnd 5e campaign. It's 3 men. One of them is a magic birdman druid. 2nd man is a 7 foot goliath run knight. 3rd man is an antisocial gloomstalker who is a sharpshooter with a bow.

The main quest so far:
The group needs to find a relic. a gnome named Tobias hired them in a span of 3 weeks to be his body guards. He hired the druid because he knows that the relic is in a Shrine, lost in the woods. He hired the Goliath because he may need his strength. And he hired the gloomstalker because he expects enemies who are following him; enemies who also want the relic. most likely 2 factions: The Strength brigade, and the Animal Kingdom. The strength brigade is controlled by larger creatures such as orcs and goliaths who enslave smaller creatures like goblins. The animal kingdom is almost entirely beastmen.
Tobias died from a wolf thrashing him.


I want the campaign to be tailored to them. include these in the game session:
- a chance to use the druid's knowledge and power of nature. He can talk to animals.
- chance for the druid to interact with the Animal Kingdom faction.
- chance for the druid to contact his diety, Silvanus, for help.
- a chance for the goliath to use his runes magic and rune knowledge.
-  chance for gloomstalker to sneak up on enemies in the dark.

Notes:


# Plan:

Recap with Tobias; a flashback.

They've taken the safe roads. Every hour, they pass wooden towers with catfolk manning the sentries. They pass by caravans of war supplies and material. It's mostly catfolk.

 Tobias is talking about the crew, highlighting their unique qualities.
(All Roll for the Negative/Positive)

His reason:
When I was young, I was saved by a Church of the First Deacon. He has a small child with him. Kid kept talking about his orc best friend. Purdue? or what it The Sapphire Peak? I don't know. forgot in my old age.

 Long ago I used to be an adventurer myself. Part of a group, tasked by royalty to do odd jobs. now these royalty, even by gnomish standards, were quite short. We called them the short kings. And I was part of the short kings elite task force. It's why I know that adventurers are the way to go. such talent. such potential! You don't get that every day, and you'd have to be an absolute phenomenon to survive in these lands.


 Anyway, my party died. We fell to the House of Basalt. All women. Before they could off me and friend, A white light blasted the executioner. Church of the First, they're good people.

 Used my potential to do what I could for them after that. cleaned up. Got married. had kids. spending my money to do what I can for Ein, their one winged god.

## For whoever took the mother
 I saw what you did with the mother. You moved first. The other guy did nothing. So i'll tell you:
This relic is an artifact that will bring back the God Ein. I've spend decades looking for it, the least I can do for all the Church has done. I'll give it to the church.

It's worth a lot of money. The House of Basalt women will literally KILL for this.

I know you're good souls. I'm telling you this just in case.

[Performance roll for Clive, see if he heard or pretended to sleep.]



I knew hiring all of y'all was the best move. 


Nighttime. 40F Cold with a light breeze.



[Kraven can turn into a horse, so the party can ride.]

## What now?
Tobias is dead. Cart is tipped. Party says to stick together until the job is done.


## A talk with Silvanus

## Short Rest?
What's the reason? What's the time limit?


## The Mother
The mother returns with a soldiers. Her head is wrapped. She points to Sha'kill and says that he's part of the invasion force. The soldiers question them.


What does the party do?
They go to the shrine.

## The Fellow Goliath
Talk to Jason in Tagalog. Goliaths can help. at least, up until they get the relic. House of Basalt will pay handsomely. It will fuel their war machine.

Talk:
Goliaths, goblins and orc in the camp. they have carts of oil distant from 


## Runes

Inside are ancient runes that Sha'kill can activate. They are activated by large mana figures that can be held in hand. Large baskets eject overhead. They activate clerical spells.

Battle is 5v5.

Relic is 'the sacred flame.' It's an unending flame in a small brassiere.

An NPC survives.

Endings

## Good Endings
- Kraven returns the relic to Ms. Tenderfoot. Her lavish home represents the Tenderfoot Wealth. She spends some time and organizes for some money to make santuaries. Kraven enjoys this, An oak leaf finds its way to his hand.

- The Church of the first sings Sha'kills praises, soon he is approached by countless adventures for challenges only he is capable of.

- Clive collects his money. No one hears from him again.

## Bad Ending/Death
- Silvanus weeps for Kraven. Occasionally, Clive and Sha'kill are visited by parrots and oak leaves in the distance.

- Sha'kills giant bones are used for goblin weapons. Worse than death, there is no glory for the forgotten.

- Clive's body is eaten by the wandering beasts of the forest. His bow is collected by wandering elves.
