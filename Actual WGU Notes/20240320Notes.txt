Okay.
Still getting the hang of doing all this commits stuff.
I'm getting better, though.
Now I'm doing all my commits from VSCode.
breakthrough - using <object> to connect html pages inside each other. It's cool. nesting stuff.
I can connect folders now.
This is all quite cool. quite fun.
I focus on the interactive.
