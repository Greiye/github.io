Okay.
Still getting the hang of doing all this commits stuff.
I'm getting better, though.
Now I'm doing all my commits from VSCode.
breakthrough - using <object> to connect html pages inside each other. It's cool. nesting stuff.
I can connect folders now.
This is all quite cool. quite fun.
I focus on the interactive.

 don't use <object>, use <iframe.> inline frame.

 Works.
 
 There's an embed feature right from itch.io.
The Gdevelop game required a web server. idk why. The format called for it.
The whole game was about 3mbs total.


 Github pages allows for only 50mbs.
