## 2024 March 20
###### Week No. 12/52
###### Wednesday.

Okay.
Still getting the hang of doing all this commits stuff.
I'm getting better, though.
Now I'm doing all my commits from VSCode.
breakthrough - using <object> to connect html pages inside each other. It's cool. nesting stuff.
I can connect folders now.
This is all quite cool. quite fun.
I focus on the interactive.

don't use <object>, use <iframe.> inline frame.

Works.
 
There's an embed feature right from itch.io.
The Gdevelop game required a web server to export to. idk why. The format called for it.
The whole game was about 3mbs total.

Polling an API?
Application Programming Interface

# Breakthroughs
- Being able to **embed** an html into another html. I can use this for my pages. Have everything on a single page.
- Images in markdown via \[\]\(\)
- Markdown is **SICK**
- (Have to use \\ backticks for escaping characters)

# Questions and Queries, Potential Todos
- HTML Progress Bar? 
- Privatize Github. So that no one reads my personal notes. I occasionally post something cringy.
- Discord/Github Webhooks.
- How to connect HTML to websocket?
- How to connect websocket to Firebase?
- JSON Database?
- Markdown to HTML? Specifically for DnD Session Notes.
- Dnd Session Notes - Previous Sessions need to be in the lore page.




#### Github Pages Max Size
1 GB.

#### Itch.io Size Limit
500MB.
This means that my games will have to be less than this for optimization reasons.

#### Phone Optimization Notes
For Interactive game and notes portions:

360x800 Typical Mobile Size.

On Webflow it's 320 width

px
em

rem

vh and ww

vmax and vmin


##### My Game Workflow
- **Aseprite** for 2D Art
- **Gdevelop** for JS interactivity
- **N/A** Music and Sound effect
- **N/A** 3D Art

##### Workflow Plans
- **PixageFX** Studio for faster pixelart processing
- **PixelOver** for animation
- **Crocotile3D** for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D Application
- **Webflow** for prototyping.

### Why Markdown
It's easy to go from:
Markdown file > Markdown app >HTML > Rendered output.

### Markdown Notes
Blockquote to show that I'm pulling the information from elsewhere.
A lot of stuff is 'pulled from elsewhere.'

## Personal

### Physical
Doing pretty good overall.
- Time in front of PC can't be good for back.

### Mental
9/10. Enjoying learning.
### Social
- Enjoy being left alone in front of the computer. for hours.
### Financial
- Still unemployed. a problem to be fixed with an obvious solution.

Non quantifiable notes
- Damn, I really like efficiency. It applies to wanting the most playability with the least amount of bytes. Pixels and etc.

# Employment
Need to find a job. a gig job will do. start working right NOW.
But I need a constant income source.

## Education Week 12/26
Hmmm. I should get on that. Remember, it's reduced college. One shot, don't blow it. 
...Why am I not chasing it relentlessly?
I'm a dog in a junkyard. I should be chasing after it.

Still gotta submit Natural Science Lab
still gotta pass web foundations.
