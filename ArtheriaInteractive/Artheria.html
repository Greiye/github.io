        <details><summary>About</summary>
        <p>The world of Artheria is a fictional world created by a close group of friends in Las Vegas, NV, inspired by DnD and countless anime/books.</p>
        <p>Special mention to Michael Go and Jason Molina.</p>

            <p>
                Artheria has modern magic and old magic. Modern Magic is more destructive and meant for dungeon crawling. 
                
                <br>Cultural spells are a thing. Elves, the ones that live in dry brush areas don't know fire magic. elves are used to some spells. but the tech behind it is constantly changing. 
                <br>cultures use different spells for different reasons.<br> the spells have different names. <br>the Wizard Society has given them more classified names. according to range, effect. etc. In some societies, magic is forbidden. <br><br>magic eras. In most settings, magic is common. what about in some places, in a single adventuring party, only one person could use magic?

            Spells is from mana. It's present in the air. and in all material. Oxygen can be turned into other elements, yes, but the thing about mana is that creatures have the ability to transmute mana all by themselves. Look to machinery transmutation machines for an example.
            <br>The mana users, mages, magicks, all have incredible output, with a coefficent that machinery could never hope to match.
            <br>The appearance of mana can be felt through many different senses.
            <ul>
                <li>Vision</li>

        </p>
        <p>
            Many mages have tried to categorize magic. But in the world of Artheria, with its constant experimentations and violence, the many mage scholars do not last long. A lot of the information is reduntant, the same topic explored in different terms written in different languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plenty of Magic categorizations. Druidic Magic, Godmagic, Rune Magic, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some humble magic users assert that the best type of magic is the kind that can be used as small conveniences in everyday life.
        </p>
        <h4>The Future of Magic</h4>
        <p>Maybe one day, magic will be common, and will be a luxury that all can afford. But with what scholars currently know, that is near impossible. A single gifted scholar, who can summon the force of hurricanes and meteors, exude mana pressure. While some machines can use this pressure, the machines would span miles upon miles, filling empty cities and towns to do what a single sentient person could do.r</p>
        <h4>The Balance of Magic</h4>
        <p>A sorcerer from long ago noticed that the natural cycle of magic is the same as the circle of life. It's a closed ecosystem where if enough magic is drawn to an area, another area loses it. The form it takes, is often unknown. The drawing of mana that destroys a forest could be used to bring lift to super fauna that grow to be meters tall. There is a law of conservation, as with all science.</p>
        <h4>Magic is for all</h4>
        <p>Some magic users are innate. Some are given the power by a diety. These innate magic users have a battery for magic. Those who generate their own mana separate from their natural body's mana, are sorcerers.</p>
        <p>But magic can be learned by everyone. Wizards exist to teach how to harness the magic of everyday life.</p>

        <h4>Magic Equation</h4>
        <p>
            There is an equation to magic. A lot of it is lost, in the many libraries of insane magic users. Often they are kept in tomes.

            
        </p>
        <h4>The Great Reset</h4>
        <p>
            There was an event. spells no longer worked. As such, there is now a hunt for the lost books. The magic that was lost to this world.

        </p>
        <h4>The Lost Art of Prestidigitation</h4>
        <p>Before, magic users could do whatever they wanted with their spells. often , the same magic that can be used to summon a small water fountain from your fingertips can be used to summon a fire.
            <p>
                Such magic is now considered Lost Magic. Now, all spells are specific in their output. The cost of Lost Magic was that it was unstable. There was no way to know the effects it had until further down the line. In one case, a wizard a grew a 2nd brain in her eyes. She at first reported blurry vision, and thoughts that were not her own. the condition worsened, until her eyes burst, revealing soft matter underneath them.
                <p>as such, Lost Magic must be researched, broken down in a controlled environment.</p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <h4>Spell Customization</h4>
        <p>The beauty of advanced spellcraft is that when all the expenses are paid, a team of sorcerers can research, run tests, and produce a modern spell tome. The spell can be copied into a wizard's method, and cleanly reproduced without the ill effects of Lost Magic.</p>

        <h2>Exporting the Story</h2>
        <details><summary>What to do with your story when it's done:</summary>
        <p>
            Take the story to as big an audience as you can find, who want to listen to it. <br>Dungeons and Dragons, for example. It started small but grew into a massive fanbase. People even made their own versions like Pathfinder, thanks to open game licensing. What's cool is that from its humble beginnings in the 1970s, D&D now inspires comics and movies.
            <br>Now, think about your own tabletop RPG. You can turn it into a book, a novel, a comic, or even act it out with your buddies for a fun YouTube video. The key here is creating your own world and story. Why is this important?
            <br> Because you have control. Your actions and choices shape the narrative, making it a truly unique piece of art.
            <br>Compare this to playing a video game where, no matter how heroic your deeds, once the game is over, it's just fanfiction. Your impact on someone else's world is limited. But when you create your own world with friends, everyone's contribution is essential. It's a collaborative process where each person's input matters, making the experience richer and more meaningful for everyone involved.

                <p>Mike's Advice;
                    <br>Once the party is formed, the DM's job is to simply throw challenges at them. See how they handle it. For the fun of it.
