Elikaen and St. Gabriel
It has been a week since the previous party disbanded.
Battle: The Fight with Ivoras
Elikaen has finally found the person she’s looking for: Her former mentor. He’s using the Einkhala Artifacts as weapons to destroy the Northern King.
St. Gabriel has learned that Elikaen’s mentor has joined with the House of Basalt. The House has taken control of the Elder Dragons.
End of Battle: Elikaen has lost her sight, slashed across the eyes. St. Gabriel loses a leg.
Chorbishop Cali restores him by using magic to transplant her own leg (A strong kind of magic unique to the Church, taught by the higher church officials.

Timeskip of 1 Month.
Elikaen’s sight is restored through her goddess Bina. The magic is strong, and has left Bina weak. She requires mana to return to her former strength. (Elikaen’s spells are weakened.)
Cali walks on crutches, missing a leg.

Elikaen talks with her deity. Bina tells her to kill the mentor. Pray in the Elven Temples. Break the artifacts to restore her power. She’s tapped into the dark magic that she knows for Elikaen’s sake. 

Cali talks to St. Gabriel. The God Ein is no longer what he is. She gives him soul gems, adapted from dragonglass. These are to capture his essence.

They’re up against an enemy. This enemy is using the artifacts of the einkhala.
They’re racing to the Summit, where the god Ein is being held.
St. Gabriel is fighting the House of Basalt.
Elikaen’s mentor has joined the house of Basalt.
The House wants to destroy Ein. The Basalt God will absorb his power. They will use the power to destroy Amethyst Peak.

The Mentor will be given part of this absorbed power. He will then use this power to kill Marcus, the King of the North. King Marcus was formerly the mentor’s rival.

Part 1: The Battle
Part 2: The Dungeon to the Top.
The dungeon is filled with magic artifacts from the time of the Orc-Human War. It is powered by an old fairy generator. They can see mana signatures all throughout the structure.
A: The First Device kills a good number of Basalt Followers. An Orcish trap. After it is activated, They can use the remaining power of the dungeon to activate their own trap.
B: The Generator
The Generator is inactive. It can be overpowered or left alone. By leaving it alone, the last trap for them is deactivated. If overpowered, they are left in the dark, able to see the following trap.
C: The Titans
There is a dysfunctional titan that slows the two down. It can be made to help them in the final battle.

Part 3: The Final Battle

3 Vantages
Number
Sight
Additional Follower

Final Battle:
The God Ein has numerous chains around him.
Eli and Gabriel need to use the soul gems to absorb his waning power in 3 different slots.

House of Basalt Archers
Ivoras

One of them must distract Ivoras and 2 other fighters.
The other must fend off the archers.

One of the gems is destroyed by Ivoras. St. Gabriel can use himself as the last soul gem.
Elikaen delivers the final fatal wound, taking Ivoras down.


Elikaen’s Decision: Kill or Spare Ivoras the Mentor.
Kill: She gains the Mentor’s weapon, which changes to her weapon of choice.

Spare: the Mentor cures Elikaen of the corrupting power she’s gained to kill him. But the corruption continues.



St. Gabriel’s Decision: The power needs to take a form that St. Gabriel can control, as Ein’s power is becoming unstable. 
Kill Ein: His suffering ends. St. Gabriel becomes a god in his place, leading the Church. He is given mighty power to shape the world as he sees fit. The Church loses all power, their healing source gone. (Neutral Ending)

Seal Ein away. Ein is no longer who he once was. His power is locked away in gems. (Neutral Ending) This retains the power of the church.

2 Points of Worldbuilding each

Epilogue (2 Days after the fighting)
Elikaen has formed a group of her own.
Ending 1: This group follows her as the Mentor’s replacement. She uses this power to help the Northern King.
If Ending 2: The group disbanded or was absorbed. She spends her remaining days looking for a way to stop the corruption. She travels to the North, towards King Marcus.


St. Gabriel is given the title of presbyter. He is the speaker of his Church.
Ending 1: He displays this power by bringing back to life a former figure of the Church. They follow his godlike powers blindly. They create a church with the Fire Genasi.

If Ending 2: The Secret of Ein is kept from the Church. There is disarray within the Different First Churches as their power is no longer available. He travels to the Church of Anarch for answers.

If combat death:
Ein is destroyed. The Elder Dragons regain their power. They use it to destroy the House of Basalt.

Elikaen and St. Gabriel are both wounded severely, no longer able to continue their adventures.
A week passes. They look at each other and consider their adventures. They think of Argo, and Yoshua, before the sun sets.

**I need help with The Rot Wizard.**
I'd like to flesh him out more. I want to understand the development and plans you've written for him.

Rot Wizard's Introduction
(DM: The Rot Wizard's first mention was about session 5, in the First Church in Ranlean. 

I had written the Rot Wizard superficially. Just someone to report back to Chorbishop Cali, confirm that there is in fact a Spellplague. The Constant wearing of the mask was to justify paranoia. Mushrooms around his cottage because I know that mushrooms grow from dead bodies and the like. I wanted his method of operation to be similar to Golgari from Magic the Gathering. I had also figured that dealing with dead people is something common medieval civilians avoid. Hence, why he lives alone.)

Further development
The Reveal, (After capturing Kori, Dr. Podrigo reveals he is the Rot Wizard. He is an unmorrowed as he calls it, someone who does not have the capacity to cast spells innately. Wizards have trace amounts of mana, not enough to cast spells like sorcerers can. But the Unmorrowed have no trace of magic whatsoever. Much like humans in the real world. Thus, they rely on magic artifacts.
