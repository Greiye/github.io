## The Ephemerals of Nepenthe

#### 01 The Island of Nepenthe
Nepenthe was a self-sufficient village on a secluded island. It was once filled with a youthful whimsy and its inhabitants often lived long, healthy lives. The land was fruitful and the plants were tinted with brilliance.
However, Nepenthe and all of its radiance faded away after it was invaded by the Arresters. The Arresters enslaved the aboriginals and this would be their life until the conquistadors could find the Seed of Thithonus.

#### 02 The Seed of Thithonus
Thithonus was once a mortal man who was granted eternal. life. Unfortunately, he was not blessed with eternal youth and he is now forced to live an endless life in old age. He has since aged to a point where he can no longer move his body. Legends state that, in an attempt to combat his curse, he created a seed that would grant him eternal youth. Although it is unconfirmed if he was successful in this endeavor, the seed is thought to reside in Nepenthe.

#### 03 Invasion of the Arresters
The Arrestors are a group of conquistadors on a quest to find the Seed of Thithonus. They believed that, with the power of immortality, they'd be able to grow their armies and conquer all of man.
The search for the seed had led them to Nepenthe where they pillaged the land and enslaved its inhabitants. They are determined to find the seed and until then, they aim to wreak havoc on the island with hopes that the seed will reveal itself.

#### 04 Anarch, Vellichor, & Petrichor
Among the tribe were three young Aasimars who differed from the others: Anarch, Vellichor, and his sister Petrichor. They were born into a life of slavery, but were convinced that this was not the life they were meant to live. Anarch was rebellious in nature and often defied the Arresters and their demands. This behavior would have been his undoing if it wasn't for his best friend, Vellichor, a calm and collected scholar. Petrichor, unlike the other two, was an extrovert who was enamored by her very existence and lived a life of unconditional compassion and kindness.

#### 05 The Evergreen Sapling
Petrichor, with her charming naivety, frequently described the beauty of a tree that would grow if the Seed Thithonus had ever been planted. Vellichor, however, found truth in this dream despite his hyper- logical mindset.
Believing that this was their only way of surviving an escape, Anarch and Vellichor searched all of Nepenthe until they found what must be the immortal tree that Petrichor envisioned. It was colossal in size and was decorated with leaves so vivid they seemed to give off a glow. Its trunk was that of a sapling and the only evidence of age was its size.

#### 06 Leap of Faith
During their search for the mythical tree, the trio was unknowingly followed by an Arrester who was unsure of their intent. Anarch grew suspicious after spotting an extra set of footsteps on their trail. Upon the potential discovery of the Evergreen Sapling, Anarch heard the approaching Arrester and felt that they needed to act quickly. He took a chance, stabbed the trunk, and licked the sap off of his blade. He urged the other two to do the same and jumped off the 100 foot cliff. into the ocean. Vellichor had attempted to collect as much sap into a vial when the Arrester had called out to them. He and Petrichor both sipped from the vial before he grabbed her and jumped.

The Ephemerals
After witnessing the trio make their jump, the Arrester chased after them towards the edge of the cliff. He peered over the edge, examined the drop, and saw no signs of life in the ocean nor did he see any chance of survival. He reported back to his leader who labeled them "The Ephemerals" due to their short-lived existence.
Back at the cliff side, bubbles rose to the surface of the water. Through the ripples in the sea, the trio emerged, seemingly unscathed. They swam to the nearest shore where they would finally experience life. This marked the immortal rebirth of the Ephemerals of Nepenthe.



------------------------------
After The Era of Ice (Artheria's Ice Age) ended, every known community began to go out and explore that which was frozen in ice and snow. This was known as the Iceless Frontier.

The Adventurer's Guild was formed. No longer just an organization of sellswords, they began to help build communities through discoveries, logistics, and organizing friendly relations with various communities that lost touch with each other during the Era of Ice. They helped bring protection and structure in the New, Lawless world of Artheria.
