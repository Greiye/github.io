Kazka and Raq: The Tale of the Hero.
Session Date July 9, Midnight 2023

Following takes place on the continent of Caerne, in the City of Ranlean. It’s been a few days since the Konnor Case. A well known court case that the whole city of Ranlean knows about. Kori is the daughter of a science researcher in the Ranlean Science Facility. RSF. There was an incident that created a riot. Some people died. Kori accuses Dr Podrigo of some sort of disease.
Raq, is a 19 Orc years old half-orc woman. She is hounded by freelance scribes looking to get more information about the court case. Raq finds this annoying. Kori and her family are still grieving. Kori hasn’t left her house since the court case.
Raq handles the freelance scribes by acting extra high and noble. She is very hush hush.
“For the good of my friends and my community, I can’t say anything.”
Raq is about people deserving to be respected and treated with dignity. Protect those who cannot protect themselves. Like Kori.
Raq starts off being angry with classmates and scribes constantly asking her for case info.
Raq isn’t stoic. She’s animated with her emotions.
“I can’t say anything”. Her face was neutral and annoyed to not give off information.
The prodding continues for five days. Raq gets used to this.
The RAINE gear is stuck on Raq. The key screws have been damaged by Konnor. The school allows her to keep it on until technicians can take it off.
Raq has been enjoying the power the gear gives her. It enables her to utilize her full orcish strength.
The clubs have been pestering her, trying to get her to join so they can win the Tria Prima Intramurals. A school competition that spans through all 3 of the cities of Ranlean, Aralon, and Amethyst Peak.
Raq decides to join the Boxing club for Ranlean College.
…
Kazka is fresh from the Einkhala quest. He is in Ranlean. It’s been a few days since then.
Kazka does research about the area up North, about the wintery area.
Tria Prima, the three cities, are in the Caerne Continent.
There is another continent north of Caerne, across the North Sea. There is magic there that constantly swirls the clouds overhead. It is winter there all throughout the seasons.
The Northernmost City on the Caerne continent is ruled by a King Marcus.
…
Soccer team asks Raq to join the team. Gear is connected to arms, not legs. No go. Track asks her to Shotput. Gear can help, but she’ll also have to do cardio. Raq decides against it. A small guy, 5’2 (Raq is 6’2) sees Raq, sees the gear, feels up her muscles a little inappropriately. Raq joins the club.
Raq wins the gold medal for Ranlean for the Boxing Division Tri-City Intramurals.

…
One day a group of kids are pretending to be heroes recounting an adventure. It became a serious fight.
One of the kids happens to be Raq’s Mom’s Friend’s Kid. An orc child. He asks for help.
She stops the fight. The mom is grateful, Raq has earned her favor.
…
Kazka meanwhile goes to a bar. Nothing extra happens.

“You asked, I answered!”
Classmates age from 15 to 19, Raq is one of the older ones
“No one’s been outside ranlean. If you knew, you’d stay home. The life of an adventurer is filled with peril and death.
Student: “We only know like 10% of the world, let us live a little.”
“Raq, you’ve seen some things. Tell us about it.”
“It’s not what you see but what you feel that changes you. (Raq Speech)

Kazka Raq Session 2

Flashback
Jerry kicks a door in
A round for us. We just did our first big boy job.
Fumir: We just did our first big boy job
Everyone gets ale separately. You’re left by yourself. Standing in a corner.
Moment to talk to someone.
Gruum: There is something I must show you, Greenskin. Take your ale.
Only at this tavern will you see this. A previous party showed me this.
1st floor. Hidden attic door. Flip a sign to the side, pull on a string. Drops the stairs up.
Leads to a landing.

Gruum
Fumir and Jerry will join us here in a bit.
You did well down there.
I never would have thought you had that power in you. It… doesn’t feel your flavor. Do you understand? Fumir’s power, it feels like her. With your eyes closed, you know its her spell. But with you… It feels like someone else’s. 

Why is that?

I know we said we’d have you for just one job. But we can’t afford NOT to have you with us. Long term.
Behind Gruum, you can see Jerry and Fumir poking their heads out from the attic door.

We want you to join Jerry’s Jackasses.

You don’t like the name? Well. Only members of our group can change it. It used to be Fumir’s Outfit before Jerry. And before that it was… just Gruum. It’s a rite in the group.

So. What’s the new name of our group?

…
He said yes, guys

Jerry and Fumir rush him with hugs. Fumi makes magical crowd-like noises.

Fumir’s hug
“I was afraid that you would say no. It’s… nice. to have a fellow tiefling around.

Jerry “Ay, there's some guy with a doohickey who just got here. He’s making like, instant paintings. But without magic. It’s wild, you gotta come check it out.

Fumir “Let’s all get a group painting. To commemorate”
Gruum Why not? Lets all take one with the Greenskin.”

Photos taken. A whole pile. Props too.

Do you take one?

Gruum ”I’m taking this one. Show my folks.” (Gruum and the Group)
Gruum’s face flashes to Raq.

Son, there’s someone I want you to meet.
Random Kazka’s Band Talk
It’s Kazka!
The Band does it again!
They’re dead! They’re all dead! And it was my fault!
Leaves rustling
He’s all washed up.
Gwanda “You’re drunk off your arse all the time, because of some tart”
He’s so handsome.
Well well, If it isn’t Kazka.
How did this happenstance happen to happen in this stance
Is it too late to be a developer?
“For your crimes against Gruum’s Bloodline, I charge you with protection of Raq.“

Back to Present
10am. Raining. Yellow hood The Guild is in the distance.

Raq
“Hey. You good? You were staring at me for a while.”

Kazka: …

It occurs to Kazka that he didn’t know who or what attacked them in Avery’s Household.

Episode 2:

Raining, 
The Gear is smoking. Bewwwwww.
Before it was weightless. Now it’s dead weight. Your arms feels like you’re carrying 15lbs on each arm.

Back to Bar
Irish Bartender

Takes a big ring of keys.
Bartender
Both of you. Kazka’s room. With me.
I told you to bring her back to her home, not make a full circle and bring her back to the guild, what’s the matter with you.

…

Ah. Okay. I understand the situation.

Little Lady, my you’ve grown. I’m sorry that all this has happened to you. You’ll have your chance to return home, but not anytime soon.

Oh, I… we never established how I know you.
My name is Gwanda. Gwanda of the Guild. I was raised by halflings.

She’s a portly wood elf Looks young. As all elves do.

She has a ring, the one she used before from when Kazka wrapped ethereal tentacles around her mouth to keep from speaking.

Kazka Arcana check for age

I’ve managed this fine establishment for centuries. I knew you when you were just this tall. When your uncle Gruum would visit. He was a man’s man, that one. He was the one that brought Kazka here.

Did Avery never tell you about your uncle?

Hmmm… Listen. You both can’t stay here. Lass, I kept you safe from the badge on Avery’s behalf, but this is too much. People came by. Posted this up on the bounty. Take a look.
500 Gold
“Raq’quoshet” Wanted ALIVE only.

This is the adventurer’s guild. The whole lot’ll want to take a piece of this action. I can keep you from authorities as best I can, but not from these shady ne’er do wells. I can’t keep watch behind you until all of this blows. You’ll need to rely on your own strength from that.

So. Kazka. Of the Band. What now?

Oh, hold on. I gotta get something.
Talk amongst each other

There’s a madman, who I still can’t believe, an RSF Chairman? (Ranlean Science facility) looking for this poor girl. And you enter a blood bond with her? Through infernal magic? How bizarre.

A Map of Western Cearne. 
“A map of Caerne. And Ranlean to boot.”

“I also went down and talked to someone about that thing on you, Raq. the machinery. I can smell it’s not working. Burnt.”
“This.. isn’t something my magic can fix. Yes, I can fix a tear in a shirt, but this contraption is nothing I’ve seen before. I can’t fix what I don’t understand. Would you like me to try?”
And Kazka, what about the Rain Temple you used to go to?

…
“I have to go. Bar calls.”
Gwanda stops at the door.

Kazka… Maybe it’s time you go home? I don’t mean this as ‘I’m tired of having you here. To be honest, it’s quite nice having you here. Security. Chores.”

Kazka, there’s something I’ve been meaning to talk to you about. The unsettling things I’ve seen from you.

Looks at Raq
“Do you want her here for this talk?”

…

“Kazka. More often than not, you talk in your sleep. You writhe in pain as these apparitions appear from your body. Long, dark, purple ooze like a kraken’s arms.I can’t make sense of it, I’ve not seen it before, and that’s a lot coming from a guildmaster.”

I think it’s time you do go home. You started unraveling with the little one. The halfling. The cave job. I never got to meet him, but Gruum expressed concern about you after that. And when he went.. It was like watching you turn into someone else.

And then Fumir left. And that was the straw that liquified the camel whole. You’ve not been the same since.

I met your father once. Precisely once. I remember it. He was larger than life.

We elves… we can taste magic, did you know? Not taste, but… we see it. Hear it. Differentiate it. Like the wetness of air when you’re close to the sea, and the smell of the salt. And no two manas from the same person are alike. Not twins, not brothers.

Your mana… is exactly like your dad’s. It’s unsettling. I look at you and I see two people superimposed in front of each other. And the mana, it gets weaker over time. With these short lives that you non-elves lead, that’s to be expected. But your mana is getting stronger the more you drink and suffer.

Go home. Center yourself. Find direction. Review the source of your power. You won’t be able to keep her safe if you don’t.

I’ll get Raq.
Is there anywhere you can go, Raq?

Campaign: The Tale of Raq

Previously, at the lab, Kori's mother informed them about the Konnor grant. She insisted that they visit the medical unit for a thorough examination of their injuries and to reevaluate Kori's infection. Consequently, they were led to separate medical bays for assessment.

Raq underwent examination, with the doctors inspecting her R.A.I.N.E. Gear and requesting its removal. However, as she attempted to comply, she momentarily blacked out, experiencing a brief red-tinted vision. Upon regaining consciousness, Raq discovered hooded figures wearing plague masks, including Dr. Prodrigo, who exclaimed, "That belongs to me!"

A battle ensued, culminating in Dr. Podrigo managing to escape through a hole in the wall, likely from one of the punches. Raq, determined, pursued him. Meanwhile, due to the commotion, Kori hurried to Raq's bay room and was shocked to find that she had fatally injured the doctors attending to her and severely harmed her own mother.

It was revealed that Raq's hallucinations were a result of the Berserker soul infused into her R.A.I.N.E. Gear by Bruno. The idea behind the Berserk soul was an attempt by the doctor to bind two souls into one body, overwhelming the mind. However, since a body is meant to house one mind and one soul, this caused Raq's mind to fracture while her body became bulkier, resulting in the berserker state.

This psychological phenomenon of the mind splitting could be referred to as "Harvey's Dent" or "Hyde Fracture" for now, or something along those lines.

Parts
The Recap
New about the court case. About the riots earlier that week. Talk about some celebrity visiting Ranlean.
Kori’s Mom: Hmmm. This is… on you. The gear isn’t coming off.
…Hey, coco… does your class have… show and tell?
2 Days later.
Kori and Raq are at school. Students are asking about what happened.
There’s a petition for the carrying of arms. Ranlean Hall wants to ban the popular custom of carrying weapons around town. “The world outside of Ranlean is dangerous. And until that perimeter wall is built, we’ll have to deal with wild animals coming in and out of the city. We need our weapons.”
“But crime has been steadily increasing with the new immigrants from the East. Open carry enables them to rob us blind when the sun comes down. We need our weapons. If it does get passed, we’ll all just be carrying concealable weapons anyway.”
“With that, at least we’ll be safer. We won’t have to worry about battle axes in the middle of town.” (Look at Raq).

Instructor: Last week I told you today is career day. We examine potential careers that can help you strengthen the city. Cement trade within the Tria Prima, also known as the agreement between Ranlean, Amethyst Peak, and Aralon.
“Who here wants to be with the guild?” (Everyone raises their hands.)
Sigh… The adventurers guild is nothing more than mercenaries sent off to war. You get a contract, you get shipped off to die. Do you still want that?”
“I want to be just like Jerry!”
“Why Jerry? You can be Fumir! The Wizard!”

The Medical Exam
The Illusion
The Horror
Podrigo Makes an appearance. He does not use magic. He uses alchemy. He has gathered information about the parasite, Konnor the first generation infected, Kori, the 2nd generation (who was bitten by Konnor). Podrigo asserts there is something lost in the phage. This is why Konnor lost his self awareness, but Kori did not.

Podrigo points to the gear: “That. is mine.”
The Berserk Soul in her RAINE Gear. Lights are flashing.
She comes to. Some scientists are dead. Splattered on the ceiling. There’s a hole in the wall.
Kori: “Raq! Meet me at your house!” She throws Raq her bag. Inside is Raq’s ax. It’s cracked in two. One blade only.
Raq runs. She ends up at the Adventurers Guild.
Scientists are looking for her.
Tavern Keeper: I know you. Come, hide.
Raq is given old clothes and is hidden underneath a drunk’s arm.
Scientists can’t find her.
Drunk woke up.
Tavern keep: You owe me more money than you can afford. I’ve done many favors for you, and you can’t accompany a scared orcish child back home to safety? One call, and the cops are here. They’ll book you for trespassing and squatting, put you in a broom closet of a cell for years to come with your future husband and that’ll be it. Lock and Key! Do you want that!? Lock! And Key! You’ll never see the light of day, breathe clean air, You’ll never see this precious Fumir of yours ever again! All this talk of some wench from your glory days, you’re not even looking for her! 

Take this child home! Do something aside from whining about some tart who left you without a word. You’ll get a week of bed and grog when you decide to bring your stray dog self back. Do as I say, you understand? Now go!

Okay Kid. Where do we go?
Decide the route of how to get back.
Quest: Get home.
Side Quest: Repair the Gear

Train ride home about the Tiefling-Orc War.
Harassed by Tieflings.

ChatGPT
I want a DnD adventure about an 18 year old half-orc barbarian woman named Raq. Raq is exiled from her hometown Ranlean because she was controlled by an evil force called the Rot Wizard. The Rot Wizard controlled her, killing several scientists that were trying to remove a robotic exoskeleton off her.
 Raq is accompanied by a former celebrity hero named Kazka. Kazka is a tiefling who has fallen on dark times and has become a drunk. Kazka introduces her to several mentors, who are all different classes in DnD. After being mentored by one of the mentors, she goes on a quest to prove to her hometown that she is not responsible for the deaths of the scientists. ( The mentors are all in different parts of the Tria Prima.)
The first mentor is a druid that contacts the others through magic. Raq must prove to them that she is worthy of learning from all these different mentors.

The training boosts her up to Lvl 10.

Candor: Rogue.
Veilo: Fighter.

Final Act: The Rot Wizard
The Rot wizard was first discovered by 


Raq’s Redemption
Raq is exiled. She needs to prove that she wasn't responsible for the Facility Attack.
It was the Rot Wizard.

Her Gear still works.
She meets Kazka.
Kazka is well known to be a Savior. It has been 2 years since Fumir left him. He knows where she is.

After the Einkhala Mission, he realized that he would be rejected by Fumir. He slinks back to his old ways.

Through Raq's mother, he realizes that Raq is Grum's daughter.

They need to leave. They travel to where Kazka has been on his many quests, meeting with the adventurers that once helped him.

With no other knowledge, Kazka goes to the adventurer's guild. They can use Kazka's status as a tool to hide and the quest board to travel to find mentors. Kazka can also grow by retracing his career. This is an adventure to the East. 

1st Stop Sornes - The Desert, and Straphan Forest.
Mission to Protect the Carriage. The carriage holds medical supplies headed to the Eastern Front, for the Tieflings.

The Rot Wizard is following them. Laughing that poor little can't go home.
He wants his Gear Back. It's one of a kind. The technology can be multiplied. Given to his army known as the Hollowed Body. He has recently made connections in the Sornes desert, with someone that specializes in Industrial Robotics. They know of Kazka. he's fought with their bionic lizards before.

The world of magic will cease. The Unmorrows will rise. 

By this time, The Rot Wizard has a squadron of Hollows, 10 units strong. They are strong enough to kill even someone like Kazka.

They see a dragon fly overhead.

2nd Stop The Swamps.
Tieflings are angry that their hero is traveling with the enemy. They follow them relentlessly. Raq's mother advises them to go to their hometown. She gives him a bottle and a scroll of true wildchange.

There they blend in. Looking for a mentor for Raq.

The Orcs have revealed a middleman. The Rot Wizard. He has taken advantage of the Orc race. They are a species that does not rely on Magic. Though primitive, they have potential.

Dr. Podrigo will use the Hollowed Host to further the orcish regime. They will have a place next to him.

By this time, The Rot Wizard has 3 units of Hollows, 30 strong. Each soldier can kill a squad of orcs/tieflings.

they see  dragon riders, flying in V formation.


3rd Fumir
Kazka hears about Fumir. This opportunity cannot be wasted. He must decide on finding a mentor for Raq or traveling to the Tiefling Lands to find her.

The Tieflings and the Orcs are headed North East. to Amethyst Peak.

By this Time, Raq can go home. her exile has ended. She has proof. Dr. Podrigo will be vilified.

If Kazka chose to stay with Raq, then his chance to see Fumir has gone.

If Kazka chose to leave Raq, then he sees Fumir. They have a moment. Fumir is not like Kazka. She's lost too much. She's lost Jerry, Grum. Choosing to leave Kazka was one of the hardest decisions she had to make.

She reveals that she kept a burnt photo of her and Jerry, a tribute to their friendship. She had Grum's sword smelt into her staff, to remind her to keep fighting through the tough times.

She then reveals a ring on her necklace. His ring. carved from their horns.
was a reminder of what could have been. a good life. a family. children. a home in a good neighborhood in Amethyst Peak.

She gave it all up, to be with her people. They needed her. and she needed them.

And now this war threatens us all. Our people.

Things have changed. Fumir has given up who she once was, for the person she is now.


The Rot Wizard
Chronological Order

“The Parasite was a specimen that was the catalyst to my realized dream. It bit Konnor, which created the Hollows. Then, Konnor bit Kori, the 2nd Generation of Hollow. It created a magic user. It brought forth the magic laid dormant in all of us.
This is great news. We can compare the generations and isolate the difference. I’m one step closer.”

“Konnor, the first hollow, was the hypha of sentient life. Devoid of magic. My strains will be better with each generation until we can be removed of the disease called magic. Until then, the hollows will be my lab hands.”


“My study is in the field of mushrooms. Why? Because mushrooms are decomposers. They break life down to their basic elements. All things come to an end. We return from whence we came.”

And magic is a perversion of that. If it means using magic to destroy magic, then it will be done.”

I deal in the dead. Decomposition. Autopsies. It’s fascinating. Chorbishop Cali, the religious official of the First Church, came to me with a wagon full of dead bodies. Exposed to the airborne agent. Dead. Every single one of them is magic users. I set that fire.”

I won that court case as Dr. Podrigo. The Darkwaters were in my back pocket. And in the newspapers, they published my victory.

It changed things. (Lex Luthor?)

Dhampicillin - Mushroom with magical properties.

The Rot Wizard Wiki
The Rot Wizard was first introduced by Chorbishop Cali, the religious official of the Church of the First in Ranlean. The Party had to take 2 infected bodies to him. He performs an autopsy. He diagnoses this as spellplague.

In the sprawling city of Ranlean, Raq, a spirited and headstrong individual, found herself unjustly exiled from her homeland. Stripped of her former life, she embarked on a journey of self-discovery, traversing untamed lands and encountering a group of remarkable mentors who would shape her destiny.

Under Kazka's tutelage, Raq learned the delicate balance between light and shadow, mastering both the art of combat and the arcane secrets that danced upon the edges of reality.

Candor, with their mastery of stealth and cunning, revealed the secrets of the shadows, training Raq in the ways of subterfuge, dexterous acrobatics, and the art of silent and deadly strikes. Under Candor's watchful eye, Raq learned to navigate the treacherous paths that lay concealed from prying eyes.

As Raq continued her journey, she crossed paths with Cerwind, a seasoned and experienced Ranger. Cerwind, a master of nature's lore, taught Raq the ways of survival in the wilderness, from tracking elusive prey to harnessing the power of the natural world. In the tranquil moments spent under Cerwind's guidance, Raq discovered her connection to the untamed forces that dwelled within her own spirit.

But the tapestry of Raq's mentors did not end there. Along her adventurous path, she encountered additional mentors, each with their own unique classes and expertise. There was Ravana, the fierce Fighter who honed Raq's combat skills, pushing her to push her limits and fight with unwavering resolve.

Ember, the enigmatic Druid, revealed the mysteries of the natural world, teaching Raq to commune with the spirits of animals and harness the elemental forces.
