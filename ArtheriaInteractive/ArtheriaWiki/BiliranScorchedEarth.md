19JA1: Scorched Earth (October 9 2022)
Billiran (Billy-Ran) is sent to find his cousin, who is in Strixhaven. He goes from his city Amethyst Peak to the portal with a knight and his squire.

Mending the Royal Tapestries’s loose threads (Session J1: Scorched Earth)
Billiran is outside the castle gates. He’s been walking around, surveying the area.

A knight and his halfling squire are at the gate waiting for him. The knight has a hand made of obsidian stone. The hand is resting on the handle of his sword, on his hip. Billiran does not know who he is. The knight tells him that his grandfather, the King, is waiting for him. Biliran ponders who this knight is, but continues on.


Biliran is barefoot, his footsteps sizzling into the carpet. “I am no longer king. It belongs to my son, who is gone now. His daughter is away.”



“I need you to find Lancia. Your cousin. She will ascend to the throne.”
“Her? Why not my father?”
“It is the way of our people. The eldest child belongs to the throne. And if not them, then their child.”

“Grandfather, I believe I am worthy of the throne. I will discuss this when I get back.”

“Of course. Go, find your cousin. Go to the portal that leads to the strixhaven academy.”

Billiran talks to his father. The father has royal clothes on, but the heat is burning.
“Boy.”
“Father. First time to this academy. Any advice?”
“I’ve never gone there. Lancia is the first to go. My brother wished this. I have prepared a guide to find the portal.”
Belial whistles.
“This is Sir Luka Celestine. His Squire, Arthur Aiden.”
King: “My little friend!”

Private talk with Father
“This is a chance for the throne. Kill the Knights. Kill Your cousin.

Biliran punches his father on the arm. His knuckles are now burned. singed.


Biliran talks to the knight and the squire. He threatens Arthur, with a booming voice tells him to not order him around.
The Plan: cross through the sulfur caverns. Reach Pele’s playground. Enter the portal.

Arthur squeaks at the heat of the caverns.

Luka raises the sword horizontally with one hand. The sword is made of glass.. He’s looking through it.

Biliran: “What are you doing?”

Luka: The Dragon Knights have earned enchanted weapons from the kingdom. This is made of dragonglass. It detects magic.”

The sword is greenish/bluish.
The way is dark. There are so many different routes that without the knight, anyone would have gotten lost. Biliran’s view is darting around.
Arthur is quiet, but one can visibly see that he’s being affected by the heat.
Luka” This has to be the way. This is the exit. I’ve been following the sword. But I don’t remember this stone figure.
The whole figure looks like a dragon head, the exit being the mouth of the dragonhead.
There is an inscription in a different language. Arthur reads it to Luka “Puff Puff”.
Biliran asks “Isn’t sulfur flammable?”


Biliran climbs up and sets alit the dragon’s nostrils. Along the way, he knocks a boulder down, attempting to hurt the knight and squire. He misses. The exit begins to light up. The noise and vibrations wake up the sulfur bats.

Battle.
Luka’s sword glows green.
Biliran smashes a bat into paste on the floor.
Arthur summons a spiritual weapon; another sword.
“Ill make quick work of these bats!” Biliran misses.
Arthur’s spiritual weapon keeps failing to summon.
Arthur summons a shield of faith to protect Luka.
Arthur summons spiritual weapon rods. They’re blue and see-through.
Biliran smashes and launches a bat to the ceiling. 

They exit the caverns.

Pele’s Playground.


A bunch of lava pools. Open sky.
Arthur summons a gray falcon familiar. It’s name is Millenia.
Biliran tries to knock Arthur into the lava pools.
The group finds a small lake filled with white light.
Biliran chucks a rock into the white lake.
Luka says to Biliran “Let’s return to the King.”
“You may not know who Biliran is. But he does not hold back. You need to come with me, or I go alone.”
While looking at them, he begins to walk backwards into the pool.
They both stop him. Arthur loses his footing. He’s thrown into the pool. Luka pulls Biliran out of the pool.
“What are you doing, why are you not following orders? You’re not even in line for the throne!”
Luka takes out his glass sword and points it at Biliran.
“As expected from the sun of the Hellflame.”
Biliran walks calmly a few feet away from Luka, his back to the Knight.
“You dare raise your sword to the son of the Hellflame? Me? Biliran? You would do best to sheath your sword. Knight.”
“Who am I? I’m one of the few greatest knights of Amethyst Peak. I’ve fought many to get to where I am now. I know who you are. You’re the son of the Hellflame. He’s never contributed anything as the king. It’s obvious he’s only there for himself. Why does King Filo continue to keep your father at his hand?.”

“Like father, like son. You’re going to be exactly like him.”

Luka brings out his sword.
Biliran is cut across the chest. Lines of lava spill out. His lava veins begin to expand throughout his body.

“YOU DARE!? WITH THE SON OF THE HELLFLAME!? I WILL BE SURE TO BRING BACK YOUR HEAD TO MY FAMILY, ASSASSIN.”



Luka adopts a fencing stance.
Biliran destroys Luka’s obsidian hand.
Luka: “I wish you were on our side.”

Biliran smashes Luka multiple times with his warhammer. Lava is pouring out of him, Even biliran’s slobbery spit is lava.

Luka is down. “I hate you.” He falls into a pool of lava.
Biliran screams out into the sky. His lava veins begin to cool. He falls to the floor exhausted. Luka’s dragonglass sword is close to Biliran.

Biliran picks it up. It’s changed. It’s now red. Looking throught it, Biliran sees an ethereal trail of which they previously followed. Biliran sees that the trail leads back to the castle.

Biliran examines his options. Return to the castle and report the assassin, or go through the portal.
Biliran cuts his waterskin into a sack and puts Luka’s smashed hand in it.
Biliran looks into the pool, pondering the adventure he may have through it. He sees students in uniforms.
“This must be Strixhaven.”
Biliran sees a female student with red hair. “It’s you. It’s Lancia.”
Biliran takes one last look around. He looks at the pool that Luka fell into, then hops into the pool, chasing after Lancia.

…
Arthur’s gray falcon, Millenia, is still around. It saw everything that transpired. It flies out from Pele’s playground, uncovered by the lava cavern ceiling. The falcon communicates with Belial. It magically relays what happened. King Filo’s mysterious secondhand man converses with Belial.
“What did he do?”
Belial: ”...Scorched Earth.”
