Session Date July 9, Midnight 2023



Up in the Northern Mountains of Caerne, a lone soldier in the heat of the autumn sun is walking up mountainous terrain. All around him are purple stones, made glossy and smooth from the many volcanoes that spot the landscape.

The man is adorned in beige armor, the handles of his flail and shield are warm from the emerging sun. Sweat beads and falls from his brow, crossing down from his tan olive skin, and into his thick beard. Sweat permeates into his green clothes, coloring his armpits a darker shade. This hike is uncomfortable. His thought is in regret, as he should have bought a donkey to carry his battle gear for him. He was warned by the merchants that the castle would be far.

But that mistake was understandable. This is the first time he’s been out this far North. He was not sure that a donkey could manage the trip. And he did not have the energy to care for a creature, especially in unfamiliar regions.

The morning dew had dispersed. With the moisture from the air gone, so too did the clouds and the fog, revealing the sparse trees in this area. The northern mountains of the Caerne continent are to be feared; many manners of beasts much larger and stronger than the common man live here, with a hostile demeanor to match the unforgiving mountainscape. Minimal vegetation calls for a land of carnivores. Care is to be paid here. Suddenly the man is thankful for not buying a donkey. The beast of burden would surely die, eaten alive the moment Veilo turned his back. Maybe by those winged creatures the townsfolk were gossiping about.

The man takes a break, stretching out on a large boulder along the path. Hours had passed since he left the last settlement. Veilo reaches into a shirt pocket, producing a brass pocket watch. 4 hours since he left. He’s not far from the end of the trail.

He pressed the watch’s adjustment knob. The pocket watch flicks open. Inside it, a photo of a family. Veilo sees himself next to a woman whose eyes look just like his. Next to her, another man. And below them, 5 nieces and nephews.

His sister wasn’t the nicest person, as their friends would say. Veilo disagrees. She was straightforward. No nonsense. Sure she wasn’t nice, but she was kind. And that’s all that really matters at the end of the day.

Maybe her kindness was why she was called back to the here-after, much earlier than planned. She leaves behind five children. 5 children that look too much like her. A flicker of grief flashes in Veilo’s chest.

Veilo closes the watch and resumes the hike. The sun is directly overhead. The fog is gone completely. He can now see the silhouette of a castle. This must be the place.

…

Veilo stands in front of a fellow human. A fellow soldier, judging from the sword handle poking out over his shoulder. His eyes are sunken in. He leans against the castle’s 15 feet tall portcullis entry. 

The size of the portcullis is awkward and unnecessary. It’s taller than normal. Taller than any other castle gate that Veilo has seen. It is a waste of resources to have it built so tall. It meant additional thicker bricks to support its size. Longer staircases to the wall’s walkway. With the soldier leaning against it as he does, He looks like an ant. And so do the sentries that peek over the wall’s embrasures.

 Is this the place that requested him?

Veilo
“Hello, Friend. Where are we?”

Upon closer inspection, Veilo can sense that this man is a seasoned fighter. A veteran. It’s in the way he moves. The way he stands relaxed, yet alert to his surroundings. War recognizes war. And Veilo feels it from the man across from him. He’s not just a fellow soldier. He’s a fellow veteran. Surely a knight.

The knight looks Veilo up and down.

Knight
“... You must be who the crown sent for. We don’t get too many visitors, you see. Ours is a new kingdom. The trail here is far too dangerous for a random passerby.”

He knocks on the Portcullis. A soldier with a sun visor looks down from an unfinished castle turret, then disappears from sight. The portcullis slowly raises.

Knight
“Welcome to the Breitling Kingdom. The King has been expecting you, Veilo. Come.”

Veilo follows.
The ceiling of the structure, like the portcullis, is much higher than necessary. A recurring theme of this new rulership. Why? Was the king a fan of extravagant architecture? As a result, Veilo feels.. Smaller. Likely a design to make the king appear larger in the mind’s eye.

They two walk through a long corridor. The occasional worker or worker pair passes Veilo and the knight as they make their way to the castle ruler. Past the workers, the castle feels unprocessed. Walls half done, windows unfinished, etc. As if the castle was an afterthought to some kind of mining operation.

Sir Luka (Knight)
“I am Sir Luka, Veilo. And thank you for coming. We received your reply a few days ago and have prepared what is needed for your arrival. The crown and court will be pleased to have you.”

Veilo
“Such extravagance, friend! This castle is… unique. The first I've seen with such high walls.”

Sir Luka
“Yes, well…
…
The King’s right hand man has told me about you. An accomplished individual with history in the field of battle. You’ve won your fair share of blood. And I suppose you’ve not seen defeat, yes? Not missing any parts, No scars to be seen. Worn armor with the occasional scratch here and there. Gashes and dents. You’re no deserter, The armor rests on your body in proper proportion. It was made for you. Not taken from a soldier slain.

Ah- forgive me. I meant not to insinuate. A new kingdom has its share of false courtmen. I’ve gotten used to their nuances. My spirit has grown weary of them and my lips and gotten loose.”

He stops, turns to Veilo and bows his head low.

Sir Luka
“I apologize, guest of the court.”

Veilo
“Oh, friend, it is quite alright. In fact, I am pleased to hear this. This is a strength that can also be used in battle. The strength of intelligence. A weapon that is held with the tongue.

I’ve spoken to many adventurers about this kingdom, and I am elated to hear about your virtues. It is rare to hear of a king that requires his court and men to be educated like the scholars of the south.

It is true, yes? Everyone here can read?”

Sir Luka raises his head, a smirk on his lips.

Sir Luka
“That is true, yes.”

He continues to lead the way. Sir Luka remains silent.

They turn a corner and walk past a set of large wooden doors, crossing into the throne room. Their entrance is immediately met by the gaze of a man who sits on the throne, his hand grasping tightly onto the handle of a claymore.

 A man in noble silk garments from the corner of the throne room sees the two enter. He stands and cries out.

Crier
“Presenting Sir Luka and Veilo! Welcome! King Breitling receives you!”

Sir Luka leans to say something to Veilo.

Sir Luka
“Veilo; You are in the presence of King Breitling. The man who sees you fit for action, at another’s suggestion.”


From afar the king looked like a large individual. Until Veilo and Sir Luke come closer. It is only when Veilo comes closer that he discovers why the gates were built so large. King Breitling is a Giant.

King Breitling sits upon his throne, his size reminiscent of an homage statue fit for the gods. His shoulders are adorned with a silk purple cloak, with white fur trim. His hair is short, about a pinch long from the scalp. No beard adorns his face. 

Left of the throne, the throne’s right hand, is a human man. A rapier hangs from his waist. He nods to Sir Luka.

In the king’s left hand, the pommel of a Claymore sword, the blade resting against the throne armrest. The sword is made of transparent crystal, the weapon’s core something like green glass. It exudes a faint green light, no doubt of magical origin. It looks to be just as long as Veilo is tall, something like 6 feet. This is the first time Veilo has seen such a weapon. 

As Veilo walks closer to the king, his neutral expression does not change. His gaze travels up and down Veilo’s armor and shield.

He stands.

The size of the Portcullis was not to display the scale of the king’s wealth, but of the king himself. King Breitling stands as tall as 12 feet.
His presence alone is enough to have Veilo bend the knee. Sir Luka joins.

Veilo:
“King Breitling, sir. 
My King.”

A moment of silence passes.

King Breitling
“Rise, Soldier.”

Veilo stands.

Breitling begins to walk about, his claymore in hand, acting as his version of a scepter. With each step, the castle floor shakes slightly.

King Breitling
“I’ve heard of you, Veilo. You’ve done well for yourself. My right hand tells me this.
The Battle of the Horizon, do you remember? Your performance was exemplary.”

“...I bring you here to address an issue. The issue of war. Something here that we are all too familiar with.”

His gaze travels to Luka. He nods. Breitling turns to the man next to the throne. With a smile, he nods and pats his rapier twice.

King Breitling
“The Black Bay Kingdom. Ruled by Deville. You know of them, yes? We have traded blows before. A familiar rival to the wealth that these mountains offer.

They once said to us that 'If I, ‘King Breitling, ruled the sky, then Black Bay would rule land and sea.’

I thought these words to be empty threats. They’ve added weight to those words. The weight of hundreds of men, trained to the sail and sword. To knots and armor. To travel the seas and gain ground steadfast.

This is a burden too heavy for me.I cannot fight them alone. I am far too small a man…

…But you know this already, do you not?”

Veilo
“...”


“I am assembling an elite force. One with the strength that these mountains have never seen before. And among this force, a need for someone with valor. Strength of character. Smart enough to study who they fight for. Efficient enough to keep their blade from unneeded slaughter.

This someone is here. In front of me.”

The King stops. He holds out his claymore poised, as if ready to knight someone.

King Breitling
“I need you, Soldier Veilo.

Will you join me?”

Veilo
“I will, my king.”

King Brietling nods.

King Breitling
“Nothing more. Nothing less.”

…









???
“...up…’’

???
“...ake.. up…”

???
“WAKE UP, VEILO!”

Veilo snaps awake, bloodshot eyes scan the surroundings. The sound of flames flickering echo off the castle walls. The cries of men in battle, their swords clashing and singing in the dance of life or death. Wings flapping throughout the sky and dragons fly overhead.

Veilo’s vision is blurred.  His body is sore, but more so his weapon arm. His familiar flail is nowhere to be found. There is a weight over his eyes. He cannot make out the man who kneels over him.

Veilo
“Wh- Who are you, Habibi? Where am I? What happened?”

???
“It is I, Teofilo. Do you not remember?”
Veilo remembers. Teofilo. The king’s right hand. He was there when he first met the king. The man with the rapier, leaning against the wall.

Teofilo
“It was I that requested for you. Have you forgotten? I had heard stories of you and thought you worthy addition to our cause.”


Veilo
“Yes, I… what happened here?. Why is there fighting?”

Teofilo
“The King… he… he is gone.”

Veilo’s memory is coming back to him, slowly. The room is familiar. It is the throne room. His gaze moves to the throne.

…What’s left of the throne. It has been demolished. Broken parts of the head rest lie cracked on the floor. The back rest is cracked down the middle. The right armrest has broken off and has fallen on its side.

At the foot of the stone throne, large, gaping holes have been dug through the castle’s brick flooring. As if men had dug tunnels from underneath the castle and violently sprung out.

Veilo
“Gone? Our King? Gone? Do… Do you mean…?”

A silent stare from Teofilo. Veilo looks down in concentration.

Veilo
“...Show me the king’s body.”

The ground rumbles. This rumbling is not from the fighting, but from something underneath them. A creature. A large creature.

From the corner of Veilo’s eye, something like a shark fin appears to swim through the castle floor. Heading straight for Teofilo.

Veilo scrambles away. It doesn’t register in Teofilo’s mind that they’re under attack. The creatures swim through them, leaving a line of raised brick between the two kingsmen.

Before Teofilo can pull out his rapier. The beast circles back. Teofilo is caught off guard, by a sudden drop kick from Veilo. It was the best thing Veilo could come up with, as he needed his hands free to fight. It sends Teofilo 10 feet away, safe from the beast.

Teofilo
“Wha-(Drop Kicked by Veilo)”

The beast breaches, making itself visible to the pair. The beast is huge, covered in chitinous scales. Its mouth could easily swallow the kingsmen.


As it breaches, it slashes at Veilo. His shield protects him from the gash, but he is sent flying, tumbling to Teofilo’s side. Rolling to a standing position, he sees that the shield has a large gash across it. Veilo’s been cut. A large gash on his shield arm, his right arm, will no doubt scar.

But Veilo was successful in his counter attack. A similar blow was exchanged as a portion of the beast’s chitin, around the right eye, was blown off. Blood flows from the beast’s eye.

…

In the middle of battle, Teofilo reaches behind him and produces the handle of a weapon, without any sort of blade.

Teofilo
“Veilo, here. A gift, from Brietling himself. “

He tosses it to Veilo.

Veilo
“...A rod? What is this?”

Teofilo
“It is a weapon. An honorary gift that marks a new member. Into the folds of the Jagged Edge Knights.

Use it.”

Veilo
“But… how?”

Teofilo smirks.
“You know well enough, mon ami. Activate it.”

Veilo takes the rod and gives it a squeeze. From the top of the rod, a crystal mass, like an 8 sided octahedron. The mass drops, glowing faintly green. It’s a Dragon glass flail.

Teofilo brandishes his rapier, his other arm behind his back in proper rapier form.
“You are re-armed. 
Now.
Let’s end this.”

The two kingsmen face this terrible beast. Fires coming from the throne room entrance and from the collapsed ceiling illuminate their faces. They fight in the name of their King. In the name of the Breitling Kingdom.

End of Chapter 1.




(Unprocessed Notes of Jason’s Veilo Session)
Upon Man is on his way, hiking up a rough mountainous terrain.
Man is green/yellow/ beige. Wearing armor shield and flail. 6 feet tall.
He takes out a brass stopwatch.
Stopwatch opens up. Photo of his sister, brother in law, and 5 niece/nephews.
Veilo’s thoughts are on his sister and her passing.
Sister is Tsundere, mean, but always looking out for everyone.
Veilo sees glossy purplish rocks
Area is hot, warm
In front of Veilo, a castle. A large door, like 13ft tall.
There is a human man in front of the castle. A knight. He is wearing armor and has a sword on his back. No additional details (His arms look normal here)
Veilo speaks with a middle eastern accent: “Hello, friend. (Habibi) Where am I? What is this?”
(Regular American accent) Knight: Hello. I am sir Luka. We are here, in front of Breitling Castle. Come, I will take you to the king.
(Player thoughts: (Is this the job? Is my character summoned here for the job?)
Veilo and Sir Luka walk through a long corridor of the castle. The walls look to be raw, made of raw materials. As if the castle was an afterthought.
Sir Luka: “King has been waiting for you.”
Veilo and Sir Luka approach the throne room. In front of them, a giant king. Even though he is sitting down, it is evident that he is practically a giant, his left hand able to envelop Veilo’s forearm. 
A man with a rapier on his hip is standing directly to the throne’s right side. He is leaning against the wall.
King Brietling even while sitting down is obviously large. His king cloak has fur, the whole thing is colored purple. Clean cut, short , ¼ long hair, almost buzz cut. 
To his side, a claymore. It is almost as tall as Veilo. Looks to be made of crystal. Core is green glass. Faint green light. THis thing is for sure magical. Veilo has never seen it before.
Upon seeing the king, Veilo instinctively bows to him.
Veilo: “My King.”
King Breitling stands up. He is as tall as the door to the castle. The castle door was about 13ft tall. King Breitling must be 12ft tall.
King Breitling has a raspy voice: “Veilo. I’ve heard about you.”
Battle of the Horizon (?)
Black Bay Kingdom
King: “Black Bay Kingdom, ruled by Deville.”
King: “They once said to us that ‘If we (the Brietling Kingdom)rule the sky, then they rule land and sea.’”
“Nothing More. Nothing Less.”
‘WAKE UP’
Veilo snaps awake. Eyes are bloodshot.
Veilo is awoken by a man. He recognizes him as King Breitling’s right hand man.
Veilo: “Habibi, who are you? What happened?”
Man: ”It is I, Teofilo. King Brietling’s right hand man.”
Veilo’s arm is sore, tired from swinging, fighting.
The Throne is demolished. Creatures have been bursting through the floor. Open gaping holes in the castle floor. Fire can be heard, echoing through the castle walls. Swords clanging. Dragons roaring.
Veilo: “Show me the king’s body.”
Ground rumbles. Something like shark fins swim through the ground. Headed for Teofilo
Veilo drop kicks Teofilo out of the way, his arms open for a counterattack from the fin creature.
Veilo and Teofilo attack.
Veilo gets hurt. A long gash along his arm. This scars Veilo.
Shark fin creature is hit, right in the eye.
…(Mikey: I didn’t write down what happened at this point)
Rapier is given as a gift (?)
Rapier is Dragon Glass?
Jagged Edge Knights
Veilo receives a rod from Teofilo
Veilo: “A rod, habibi? What is this?”
Teofilo: “Activate it.”
Veilo uses the rod. From the rod, a metal ball forms. Then it drops from the rod, still connected by a line. It is a dragonglass mace.
Teofilo and Veilo begin combat with the shark fin creature (Mikey: known as a bulette)
End of Session

Where is the king?
‘Veilo: Last time I saw the king, he was right here… sitting on the throne…

Leave
Battle is quiet. Flames still flickering.
Sir Luka is missing a hand. He’s pulling a sword out of the same beast.
Recounts the battle outside the castle.
We had a dragon army. They were slain by the Deville. It was him. His trademark armor.
A single horizontal strike. decimation.
Our King. The Giant. On his humongous Dragon mount.
“It has been a week since I have been brought here.
I chose to help with the fighting since I thought it was for the greater good.
I will follow you, Teofilo. You are the acting king as his right hand, yes?
But I advise that you keep your pace slow. Lest you lose two important persons “(pointing to Luka’s hand.)
Teofilo: Let us go.
