Our own Tabletop
Why?

Wizards of the Coast tried to steal an open license. Profit off of it. Sooner or later, corporate greed wants to sell everything. They’d sell air to us if they could.

Make your own. Keep it amongst friends. Chess is just a bunch of wood on a square. We assign meaning to the pieces. So assign meaning to the game you and your friends make together.

Word of Hasbro/Wot.Coast Is still trying to monetize everything.
Thus, I don’t want to play the Brand DnD anymore. I want my own TTRPG.

IMPORTANT
Getting better at markup language.
starting to code now.

so. what really differentiates video games with DnD tabletop?

the tech is just to automate. days, weather, etc.

what needs to stay, when turning a tabletop into a hybrid?
-the battle actions needs to stay word of mouth.
-the ‘how dop you want to do this’ deaths need to stay.

what needs to go?
the math.
setting the initiative turn order.
have a turn order that plainly shows the monster’s AC.
when a player wants to cast a spell, the spells take into account the monster stats.
there’s just a big button that ends the turn.
and big counters that stay on one’s screen to count round negatives.

. it takes a 5 second hold down to remove. with a redo button that you hold for 2 seconds.



what needs to be improved upon?

From Sseth, it’s literally insane. Magic comes after the end of the modern world. It’s mutations from a post apocalyptic world.

It’s not about a distraction from life. It’s a life supplement.
