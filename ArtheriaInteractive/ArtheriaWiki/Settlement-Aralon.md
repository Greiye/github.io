# Aralon
A small farming Town, Aralon is known to be the hub of creatives and artists, often in the Hanging Gardens. Thanks to the numerous salt flats close to the town, Aralon can provide everyone with quality food products to all neighboring settlements. Citizens are always wearing raincoats and hats in the event of sudden rain.

On the outskirts of town is a **farmer’s market**, where you can meet Granny Smith and her pets, Magic Greer and all his magical wares. Be sure to visit Father Padre who runs a Chapel of the First.

Petrichor is a popular god of Agriculture in this part of the Hymlie Principality.

## Aralon’s Goal:
A Peaceful life is its own reward. Everyone has a right to it. Acknowledge it, cherish it, for when it is gone in the storm of life, it is all that you wish you had.
