Zeph Epilogue (From when I DMâ€™ed for random players on rolegate, 2018?)
Only in the village of Eylon can you find High Elves and Drow living in harmony; its natural stone walls protecting the glade it surrounds. Though the elven guards do great work patrolling in the day, the Drow do better. Nothing gets past them in their element.

As such, their composite High Elven/Drow crafts are well protected. If only more merchants came to spread their wares.


The elder Drow of the village see promise in you, seeing how nimble you climb the walls and respond to situations with intellect. Your guard position at such a young age reflects that. Or could it be pity, for what happened to you not too long ago...

It's not enough. As the days and weeks pass, you feel stagnant in this small city. The elders never let you out of their sight. Out there is a world of chaos. Experiences. Something in you thirsts for it.  Is the world outside these walls your calling? You're not really sure what to do with your life.

Really the only thing worth staying for is...her.

As you daydream of this during your shift, you are pelted in the face by something soft and wet. It drags down your leather armor and plops on the stone floor.

Looking down, you see a small cloth bag. As soon as you open it, the smell of rotten bugs and spiders fills your nostrils.

"Don't fall asleep on guard duty, Zephy!"

You need not peer down into the bright darkness. It's the voice of Azurt, the high elf son of the village toolsmith. He's followed by his usual gang of cronies.

"Wouldn't want a clan of goblins attack us now would we?" The entourage laughs at this. They only hang around Azurt for his money. What little his family has more of than the rest. "The only good you have are your eyes. If it was my shift, the village would sleep peacefully."

Today, he has gone too far.

1: Teach him a lesson with your fists. The Drow believe in displays of strength to establish dominance.

2: Let this go. No other guards saw this. Relations between the drow and elves here are tense. Your people are not the violent maniacs the world believes they are.

Without pause, you deftly climb down the 20ft stone face with absolute dexterity, and are inches away from Azurt's face. Before he can say a word, you reel back a fist and punch him square in the nose. There is an audible crack as he goes down.

His cronies rush you. Quickly overpowered,  you are beaten to the ground and promptly pissed on.  You are a shamed and bloody mess. The space behind your left ear is especially tender and wet.

When you return to the orphanage, your close friend Zedana treats your wounds with a soft, familiar touch. You dare not mention this.

-1 Hit Point Damage
-small scar behind your left ear





2 You return to your post, unbent. Unaffected. Azurt and friends laugh at you off, and leave. The smell lingers on your armor.

The next dusk (as drow meditate in the day) you are approached by a drow elder, and told it's best you quit. News of what happened spread quickly, and the drow will not trust someone who cannot protect themselves, much less the village. Return your things.

The following dusk, (as drow meditate in the day)you are removed from your post by the high elf elders. They tell you to return your guard equipment and go.


As you stand in the armory, you bathe in your emotions privately. This is it. This was the final straw. Ashamed and Angry, you decide to leave now. Right now. That will show the village. And you'll take some supplies as well.


Azurt's guard armor catches your eye. You never noticed before, but it does have a glimmer in the interior. You discover that it has magical properties, a touch gem inside the right interior pocket. It must be nice having a smith for a father.

1 Damage it and show it to his father. His father is an angry drunk. Must be a tradeoff for his smithing skills.

2 Swap it with your uniform. They're identical, save for the gem inside.



"You're leaving, aren't you?" A soft, sweet voice whispers.

You turn to Zedana. Had you packed quicker, she would not have seen you disappear into the night. No words come to mind, to make up for you leaving her.

She walks closer to you.

"...I knew you would one day. I can't see you living your whole life in Eylon. The calm and quiet isn't for you. You're meant for more."

She rummages through her stuff, and produces a few gold coins, a used healer's kit, and some rations. She shoves them into your chest.

"Promise me you'll be safe. I can't patch you up like I did when we were kids when you're gone.

Eat well. And don't steal if you can't help it. I know you're good at it, but it hurts people in unexpected ways, you know?"

Zedana looks into your eyes, as if to commit their red hue in memory. 

She gives you a smile, but her lips quiver ever so slightly as she turns to rest her elbows against the window pane. Soft moonlight caresses her figure.

"Come back soon. Come back safe."

"I'll be here when you return."

1 Hug her. It's something high elves do. To show affection?

2 Turn to leave. The longer you stay the more drow might see you leave the village.



You wrap your arms around her gently, forcing an odd sigh from the both of you. She's warm. Like those torches humans sometimes carry. She's unsure of what to do, her hand around your forearm. She drops her hand quickly.

"Go. Before the others see."



The fellow guard buys your excuse of needing you elsewhere. As soon as he's around a building corner, you lift the gates enough, and roll underneath as it closes.


You take one last look at the village you call home. Where you were bullied all your years. Where Zedana resides. 

Anger is burning in your eyes and stomach. Your mind has cooled. Zedana was right. You're meant for more than this peaceful, safe glade. As you disappear into the dark of the woods, you know that you'll prove it when you one day return.

You make your way west, to prolong the night.
