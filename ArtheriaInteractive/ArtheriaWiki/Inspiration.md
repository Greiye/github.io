Eteria has many names, and for the speakers of Common, it is known as such. Many believe the world was created and destroyed many times over, thus explaining the many treasures one finds within the world. It was created by Mortal Gods, clinging essence from the Immortal.

Medieval Justice - Mikey Synopsis
 In 1000 AD England, people would take an oath, saying what their event recollection was the truth. They would do odd things like hold a burning hot iron in court. If it healed, they were telling the truth. Seems that anything beneficial was seen as the work of God then.

People would also get a champion to fight for them in a trial by combat. The winning champion would be seen to be favored by god, thus, their recollection was truth. The King put a stop to Trial by Combat. Spoken words only would win court cases. Even back then, smaller courts were held for the severity of the crime.

People could recite bible verses, sparing them from death. The more you know about God, the better. People would also run into the churches and stay there for 40 days, protected from arrest. This became known to be ‘Seeking Sanctuary.” People could choose to surrender to trial or exile themselves to leave the country.
