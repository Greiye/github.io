Elves
Elves come from a primitive homeworld. Due to their long lives of 1000 years, they have witnessed many events. One event being the creation of humans. Their literature is considered to be of high quality to scholars and archeologists as their cultural pride made their content highly researched and valued to be as accurate as possible.

After the creation of humans, the elves have become mostly seclusive to their own. This was due to fear of the unknown, as well as humans having an appearance weirdly uncanny to elves, except for the ears and height. 

Elves live in secluded villages and towns that are difficult to reach due to predators in their past. These settlements are often protected by means of magic as a secondary line of defense.

Of all the races, elves are considered the most unforgiving, holding grudges for centuries.They attack beastmen on sight and see humans as ‘inbred elves’. They are hostile towards orcs due to their learned history of raiding and war. While they find Tieflings unsightly, they do enjoy long conversations with them about magic. 

They enjoy halflings, taking kinship in their long lifespan of about 400 years. Most agree that they are undisciplined, compared to the common elf.

The Elven Capital is where the elves believe the Travelers first landed on Atheria. The heart of the city is an academy. In this academy, there is a structure made of metal and rust, believed to house all of the knowledge of the Fairies and the Elven Ancestors. This structure is guarded by a small army of metal golems, guided by the wielder of a circlet. The circlet is worn by the Elven King.

The structure is off limits to the local populace, guarded by the Royal Army. Any attempt to break past the gates is met with death. 

There have been attempts to study the structure; all met with destruction by the hands of the golem guards. It seems only the wielder of a circlet can bypass the guards. In Elven history, a queen was brave enough to enter the structure with a 2nd circlet, the queen’s circlet, never to return. Some elven archeologists say that most likely part of the structure collapsed, killing the brave queen. With no one else able to enter except for the king, she was doomed. It would have been foolish for the leader of the elven society to go after her, leaving the throne open. There was also the chance of the last circlet disappearing with the king, leaving the structure’s only key into the structure gone forever.

In elven history, the travelers were mostly elves and fairies working together. Archeologists say that a fairy may be the key to entering the structure without the need of a circlet. But with the extinction of fairies, that method too, is no longer possible.

Elves look down on other elves that regularly interact with other races, as they see that their society is everything an elf could ask for. “City elves must enjoy living in the slums that only a mixed society can afford.”

To keep updated in continent news, Elves will travel to other elf-populated towns to converse and keep each other safe. This creates an odd gray area for elves that live in the city, because how else would their ‘more pure’ cohorts learn of continent affairs if not for them? Elves commonly have identity issues that deal with tradition versus modernity.

Depending on where they live, elves have been noted to absorb the elements around them, their magic casting adopting the texture and color of where they’ve been raised. The Elves that spent their childhood in the desert have a sandy feel to them; their forest relatives, casting with the appearance of leaves and twigs.

Elves are practically humans, but their relationship with mana makes them live longer. Their bodies are more elongated, their longevity up to thousands of years. They physically do not age, but instead their mana ages over time. Other mana users can sense this. Mana users remark that older elves, if not taken care of, feel greasy, and smell like older humans.

Elves usually live 1000 years. By their 900th year, their magic begins to fade. By 950, they can no longer cast magic. They begin to lose perception of time. They begin to fade, appearing like a ghost with a glowing center. They meditate for one last time. When this happens, they fade away, becoming part of their biome. Wood elves turn into wood, Tundra elves become ice. After death, a ritual is held. In this ritual, friends and family of the deceased are taken to the wildlands closest to where they died. The remains of the deceased are mixed back into the world. A bonfire is started, and the personal belongings of the deceased are burned. Whatever is left in the bonfire’s ashes is melted down or given to the next of kin. The melting down is seen as another act of becoming one with the land once again.

Beastmen
After the war along the giants in ancient history, Beastmen were hunted due to their former alliance with the giants. They took shelter in the wilds where no other race could survive. They fought with one another for leadership, but that endeavor has since dissolved as they adapted to their new surroundings.

Now the beastmen have found purpose in taming animals and becoming close to animals that closely resemble them as well as other beasts. It is common for those from the feather clan to have a roost of eagles and falcons, and so on.

Every 4 years, beastmen from around the continent will travel to a competition sponsored by a beastman settlement to see who can win the beastman artifact for their tribe. The Artifact is a kind of cloak that signifies the clan that is most ready for war. The competition became a regular event to control the beastmen’s hunger for war, without reducing their already dwindling population.


The occasional beastman can be found in mixed society, but only if they are traveling with their ‘herd’ or ‘flock’. They are more trusted than orcs, but not by much. Still, if in need for a finely tamed creature, a beastman’s bond has no competition in quality.

Beastmen come in all shapes and sizes, living in tribes where the majority is one specific subculture of beast. The beast they have similarities to is the creature they worship. Their method of worship varies greatly between tribes. Some capture and release their totem as a rite of passage, some eat their totem. Often their totem is nearby or tamed into servitude, depending on the animal’s nature and chance of predating the tribe.

Beastmen who try to procreate with another beast culture are met with disappointment. Their genes are not fit. Often these offspring are cast out. Some speculate that this practice is why there are so many odd creatures in the wilds.

Halflings
For a time, halflings were resentful of their captors, the beastmen and the elves. But that dissent disappeared with time. As they live long lives compared to most other races, they have used that time to reflect and forgive. Most halflings live peaceful lives, drinking and eating for most of their days, stirring up good times with instruments in hand. This race works hard just as much as they play hard, spending 2 days of the week working tirelessly in the mines, inventing, and cooking up delicious food. Being natives of Artheria, they have the most knowledge of cuisine. All throughout the land, even in elvish society, they have restaurants that sell their food. Legend has it that a small number of large conflicts have been solved by a bowl of halfling stew.

As such, most other races leave halflings alone, actively seeking them out for recipes and cooking advice. But make no mistake, a halfling can be useful in situations that require a small body. Halflings have been known to join the Adventurer’s Guild for a more exciting lifestyle, specifically in asset recollection or exploration. A few halflings know their way around the blade.

Humans
The most adaptable of the races, humans find their way into most societies as ambassadors. Much like the fairies, the majority of them learn their magic through using natural components and mana-infused items. Their adaptability has also led them to be conduits of magic, with the occasional human being able to cast spells from a magical deity or patron.
 Unlike their elven ancestors, the ability to manipulate magic does not come naturally to them. Although the ability to cast magic from within is still there, the occasional human being is able to do so after rigorous training and practice. 
Humans can be found living in almost every settlement of every race, their adaptability a universally prized trait. If a human is living among elves, their spellcasting ability must be greater than the surrounding elves. If they are living amongst the beastfolk, their relationship to animals must be practically magical. If a human amongst orcs, they must either be an outstanding fighter or just as merciless.
Humans are not only highly adaptable by behavior but by their genetic makeup. Records of Half-Orc, Half-Elves exist, as well as half-beastmen and half-tieflings, although with severe impairment. Half-Orcs and Half-Elves seem to be the most stable pairing.

Humans are the byproduct of Elves that were left alone to interbreed between themselves for millenia. Their crossbreed nature makes them adaptable.

Tieflings
Born from the First Warlock, Tieflings are looked down upon in human society and attacked on sight by Orcs. Their name comes from a term meaning ‘low’ or ‘deep’, as if the power given to them comes from an obscure entity that clawled from the dark depths of a terrible place. They have inherited their magical ability from the elves as was guaranteed in the promise, at the cost of their appearance. They are regarded as ill omens, their dark magic a reason for vigilance and caution. Most uneducated people in smaller towns are afraid of them on appearance alone, much like orcs or beastmen.
It is unclear which powerful entity their common ancestor gave his soul to, but a side effect of their gift is that they are strongly resistant to fire. A Tiefling can withstand boiling temperatures for hours and can even stand on fire for a long period of time before being burned.

If a tiefling is in a society that permits their residence, they are more often than not placed in the more dangerous part of town. Still, their resistance to heat makes them prized as firefighters. Their given talent for magic makes them excellent magic users, on par with elves. Unlike elves, the appearance of their casting is alarming. Their bright yellow or red eyes flicker with the shimmer of fire, their spellcasting voice deepens to an inhuman low pitch. Some say that the most powerful spellcasters dim the area of light, making their spells that much more intimidating.

During their inception as a people, some tieflings report visions of crossing into the dark planes, soaking in the mana of dark spirits. Their skin can range from a bright red to purple due to the alien habitat they were forced to live in, A kind of place where birds, fish and reptiles thrived. The brightness of their skin displayed that they are masters of fleeing. Their horns, from the animals that butt heads. Their small control of fire and vestigial tails, a remnant of the cold dark place their former spirits chose to live in.

Random Traits of Birth
Tieflings are born with various animal-like traits that appear demonic. Their people see these as different signs, and closeness to certain demons that they believe in.
The Vast majority of Tieflings have Horns and a tail. Some people celebrate this, other families who live in mixed societies find this detrimental. Other traits include:
Fur Length and Color
Additional Ears
Additional Eyes and Eye Color
Pupil Shape
More than one set of horns
More than one tail
Hooved Feet
Various tail type and length
Skin Color

Magic Casting Appearance
The Majority of Tieflings cast magic

Propensity to Wizardry, Warlocks and Magic.
Because of their people’s relation to magic, the Tieflings have an innate call to the dark arts. Forces outside their understanding protect them. Their ancestor, the Scholar (Or First Patron?) had developed never before seen summoning magic. As homage to this, Teiflings use Alchemy circles as identifiers for each other. Their letter signatures are often their favorite alchemy circle.

Different Colors, Magic. All disturbing and aggressive. Unsettling. 


Orcs
Orcs came into being from Humans. Humans used the knowledge of the fairies, using what they called ‘Ashen Magic’ to try and regain the ability to use magic. This was combined with the technology invented in Artheria. The spell ultimately failed, creating orcs. The spell corrupted the humans who ran the experiment, mutating them into a new type of sentient being.

Because of their degenerative bloodline, the majority of orcs are unintelligent and aggressive, making them the most despised of all the races throughout the land. They are unwelcome in most societies, the intelligent ones having to cover the color of their greenish skin.

The only accepted orcs are those of nobility, well known throughout the land as charming, strong, intelligent individuals capable of anything they set their endeavors on, provided they show proof of legitimacy. Often these nobility will go out of their way to dress in the best quality garments or armor they can find, decorated with their house’s symbol.
Despite this, Tieflings still look down upon them as much as other societies look down on them due to the current war.

Fighting an orc in combat is just as dangerous as fighting a wild animal, their natural physique letting them fight longer than even beastmen.

Orcs are often vying to show who the most capable house members are, joining any competition that will bring honor to their name. Some orcs attribute this to their nature, saying that even the most unintelligent orc wants to prove their might in combat for their tribe.

Orcish Colors
Skin can range from Human colors to dark green, almost black olive skin tone.
Degenerate Orcs choose to wear what is available. Their ripped clothing and discarded armors are stolen and poorly sewn together.

Noble Orcs choose to adorn their bodies and jewelries with colors that match their skin tone. Major colors are red, orange, brown, gray and gold.

Because of their population being majority degenerative orcs who are more brawn than brain, the Noble orcs (despite their Intelligence and mental adaptability on par with Elves), must prove their strength to their warring kin. Their armor is fierce, often blood soaked, battle worn and depicts the brutalism of war. The most savage of Orc tribes will have flags of living enemies, with limbs broken, their skin flayed, etc. kept alive until a suitable replacement can be broken down and dismembered in front of enemies.

The Noble Orcs in discussion with other intellectuals, despise this method of control. But better they do this, than someone who does this in joy. It is a necessary evil in the most brutal of Orc clans.

The more civil orc clans merely wish to display their strength amongst each other. Some Nobility were successful in channeling their habits to constructive events such as sports rallies. Thus, they can be crowned the strongest in a division, their competitiveness slaked.

Other Races
Because of ‘The Promise that Shattered the World’, other races have been documented traveling Caerne. Some come from the portals that have opened all over the continent (known as Portalites). These races are often stared at, either from a place of intrigue or distrust.

Wherever they find themselves, people usually form their opinions of them from the local gossip.

Extinct Races
Giants
	Twice the size of even the largest of beastmen or orc, the giants were a fearsome force to behold. The Scriptures say that the giants were slave mongers, believing that the leader is supposed to rule with might. They had 6 fingers, like 2 middle fingers of any humanoid being. Bones like iron, and could crush the throat of an elf with just 3 fingers.

The Giants went extinct during the Frozen Struggle, when the other races banded together to destroy them. Only scraps of information about the giants exist. One notable excerpt is that during the migration (before the Era of Ice), the Giant Soldiers always came from the North.

Similar to humans except their hands have six fingers, their bodies like wood. Savage sentient creatures that think of war, and do not believe in diplomacy. Their culture breeds the best warriors. Their culture has led to their numbers dropping. Estimated population is something like 5,000. They travel and live off giant animals. Their technology because of their culture has stayed in the Stone Age. They are a First Race, existing before the great migration.


Fairies
	The fairies were small, ferociously intelligent creatures that could sit on the palm of an elf’s hand. They had 4 wings like butterflies, except much thinner and longer.

These humanoids could cast spells with ease. Archeologists assert that the wings may have been vestigial, and that their wings were like sails that flew on the invisible currents of mana all around them.
It is documented that during ‘the passage’, the fairies lost their ability to fly. They also slowly lost their link to magic, their spells getting weaker and weaker as time went on. This could have been a potential catalyst to create technology that did not depend on one’s innate mana amount to function. They are a First Race, existing before the great migration.

An interesting excerpt about the fairies is that in ancient times, savage tribes would capture and grind up the fairies alive. When the fairies were killed in this way, bright lights of various colors would blast from their bodies, as well as emitting a stunning force that could knock out a grown man. This mixture would then dry for some time. Beastmen and Giants would snort this Fairy Powder, permanently imbuing them with the ability to use mana and cast spells at an unprecedented level.

The surviving tomes show diagrams of a single powerful fairy lifting giant trees and boulders using magic alone. The same diagram also shows giants burning freshly cut trees to smoke them out.

Changelings
Elven books say that for a short time, a small group of sentient humanoids existed along with the first giant and the first man. These creatures were called changelings, having the ability to change their appearance and genetic makeup at will to better adapt to their environment. Within a short time (days or weeks), Changelings could alter their teeth to become carnivorous or gills to breathe water. Most believe they are the proto-types of all races. Only scraps of information exist about them, some going as far as saying that they’re works of fiction by an ancient elf writer. If they did exist, they were left behind in the migration.

Spirits
Not exactly a race per se, but beings of pure mana that needed very little to survive. These spirits enveloped the first world, becoming living creatures once their form permanently stabilized. The books say some of them never changed form, drifting among other spirits that did stabilize.

Ancient elven books say that these spirits could have ranged from the size of an ant to a creature that stood above the largest of forests.
