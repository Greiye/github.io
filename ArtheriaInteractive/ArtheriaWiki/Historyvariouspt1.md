The Iceless Frontier: For Aevelon
Year 1980.

The Era of Ice lasted something like 4000 years. When the humans were systematically cast out from elven society, they were just entering their copper age. Stories passed that someone had found the Chalice and used it to purify the world. The Era of Ice ended, beginning an era of relative peace.

The Halflings, Elves, Humans, Orcs, Tieflings and Beastmen began to intermingle and trade on the only discovered continent called Caerne. The Tria Prima was created, with the united manpower of all participating races. By this time, the Medieval Age began. Ranlean, Aralon and Amethyst Peak were founded.

Kazka Zamir: The Tiefling Hero
Year 2000 

Kazka Zamir is a hero that emerged during his time with the Adventurer’s Guide. He traveled with a halfling who specialized in bombs, a large orc who was the Swordmaster leader of his first band, and his would-be lover Fumir, a fellow Tiefling Wizard. During the Era of Ice, it would have been impossible for such a party to form. The Halflings, Orcs, and Tieflings were in a racial competition for survival, due to the low amount of food caused by the cold.

Kazka’s party was known throughout the band, before the death of half the team. The first death was the halfling hero. While investigating a cave for monstrosities. They found Driders: Elves corrupted by the demonic forces that came from “The Promise that Shattered the World.”. They were hunted to extinction.

Other notable events in Kazka’s life is when he took down the Sea Serpent that was killing off the Halflings. He also destroyed a demonic weapon that took control of people, in order to create the perfect mechanical body for itself. It was known as the Scavenger Spear.

Childhood: The son of a famous warlock known as Kavik Zamir. He grew up in Aralon, a quiet town his father had decided to retire in after his decorated career in adventuring. His father’s fortune and fame came from his amazing feats as a powerful warlock. He retired soon after the death of his team and settled down. After Kazka was born he aimed to help him become the next greatest warlock. His childhood was far from rough, but his father, unfortunately passed away after introducing him to his patron. This is when Kazka learned the true cost of his father’s quest for power.

When his father was young he had made a contract with his patron that he would exchange power for pain and suffering to those around him. Although he was a great adventurer with great intentions he was unaware of how this pain and suffering would manifest. His quest for fame and fortune had blinded him from all the pain and suffering he had inadvertently caused. Like, the death of his team.

Former Teammates were Grum, the Half-Orc Fighter, Fumir the Sorceress, and Jerry the Halfling Rogue Bomber.



Return of War

War did return to Caerne, centuries later. The Orcish population proliferated faster than the other races. Orcs found that their bloodline was faulty. Orc women all over their society began to have children with degenerative traits. They cast out these defective, smaller orcs. These smaller orcs returned like pests. They are now known as goblins. Like their Orc ancestors, their population grew exponentially, until they could be found raiding hamlets throughout the land.

They began to seek answers for their stillbirths and the goblin disaster from the colleges. Their history with the humans as well as their predatory physique made their society untrusted throughout the land. Their population began to degenerate. Their society fell apart, fracturing into smaller societies until they became tribes of raiders and pirates. Tiefling societies were the first to be consistently raided.

A bloodline of orcs that retained their intelligence became the nobles of their society, forced to lead their feral brothers and sisters until they can solve their degenerating gene issue.

The Tiefling-Orc War was the catalyst for the Adventurer’s Guild. At first, it was a call to arms for mercenaries to fight for the Tieflings, but in time converted to a guild that sent agents out for profit. They specialize in war contracting, exploration and asset recollection.

The Adventurer’s guild is actively searching for the Chalice that was said to have ended the Era of Ice. It is said to reside in a place called Aevelon.

The Guild has also dispatched many adventurers to unexplored continents, but no adventurer has yet to return.
