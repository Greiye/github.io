### The Pendragon Lineage
Legends of an Elf bearing the name Pendragon. He was the one who organized battle tactics that freed his elven people and the Fairies. Together, the Elven-Fairy Collective created a magic-based technological society that kept the Beastmen/Giant Aggregate and the rampant spirits at bay. Pendragon was also able to use the wandering spirits in their favor.

Pendragon was said to be the first king. They used magic as the vehicle that enabled the invention of advanced weapons. But the giants and the beastmen had their own scholars, adapting to the technology of their former slaves.

A Pendragon will have longer ears than any of the other elves.

As if the planet was fighting back, corrupted spirits born from the pollution rose, destroying the societies of both sides. 

This violence lasted for 800 years with the occasional unofficial ceasefires and broken truces. This is how they managed to follow the elves and the fairies across space. They had evolved from their stone age counterparts into a rough warrior society that could reverse engineer the Elven-Fairy Collective’s technology. The constant arms race created pollution that made monstrosities of the flora and fauna. Records of giant plants that swallowed giants whole. Forests were burned down, Landforms decimated for the sake of strategic positioning. The world became sludge as both sides used the land’s materials to feed the war machine.
