The Forgotten Adventure
Long ago, you embarked on a quest with your party; one you’ve grown attached to. The quest was for a weapon, said to faintly glow a crimson red, a red ruby in the hilt of the handle. Legends say that the weapon was wielded by generals, responsible for countless victories in history.

 This is how the Adventure went:

The Seedling

The party mage senses a strong magical presence in a broken fountain. The ranger identifies it as a type of pine, native to a forest hundreds of miles away. This is notable, for the ruins you are to enter are desolate. Sand blows past you, rustling the piles of bones by the entrance. Somehow, this pine seedling is growing despite a lack of moisture.

Do you uproot it to be examined or leave it be? It may not survive the coming winter.

The Trap
You remember at some point a trap right after the entrance. The rogues had no issue going past it, but… you don’t remember what it was exactly. Something with the floor?

Signs of Felidae
As your party travels deeper into the dungeon ruins, you remember identifying the decor of Felidae; The Cat God.

Last time you were here, you remember a large podium, and the smell of dander. You pass the room with no issue.

The Battle
Your party had encountered a necromancer and an army of undead.  Frightened by what you saw, you and an injured member flee, leaving the rest of your party to be eaten alive in front of a large, frozen door.
...when you come to, you see that the barbarian that carried you out had expired to his wounds. Eric. That was his name. You take his ax and return it to his tribe. After this, you take a season off from adventuring. You take quests you know you can handle, but the excitement is gone. You start a family, and enjoy a simple life.
...
Prompted by your son’s letter, you don your armors and leave, almost forgetting the blood soaked map that Eric had been making as your former party advanced into the ruins.

Party Link
Arthur (Drew): You’re not sure, but you think that your son saw you in tears during a vulnerable moment. What was that moment?

Uthal (Brandon): Shortly after meeting with a female friend, the fledgling Goliath seems distant to you. Who was that woman, and what was your relationship with her?

Durin (Keanu): You helped him climb the ranks of his faith, sacrificing something you cherish for him. How did you help the orphan dwarf, and at what cost?

Jegolas (Joey): The teenage Dark Elf got into some trouble at a brothel, and was on his way to become a slave. How did you help, and how do you think he’ll one day return the favor?
(In this world Dark Elves are still viewed to be as bad as goblins and orcs)
