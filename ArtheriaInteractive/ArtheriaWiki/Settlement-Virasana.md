Virasana
A settlement that chooses to live in harmony with nature.
People often have no sense of ownership here, aside from nature’s ownership.
There is a notable lack of boundaries and physical structures such as gates, fences, and the like. Most Virasanans gather their goods from symbiotic relationships with the plants and animals around them.

Most people live with each other, occasionally staying at each other’s ‘homes’.
