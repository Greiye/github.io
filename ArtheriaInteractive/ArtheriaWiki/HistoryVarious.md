Timeline and Events

The First World
Titans of Creation
“Lower beings do not understand the scope, the machinations of life.
In them, worlds as worthy to life as they.
We are the gods of the existence within us
If such beings live within us, then we are but cells within a cosmic body.”
In the ancient elven scriptures, it is said that the universe was made by giants , their scale beyond comprehension. There may be a chance that the universe is a titan itself, and that the planet is just one cell among the trillions of cells that make up a titan.
Celestial Conflict
“In that vein of thought, a war of gods did happen.
For millennia they fought, the centuries mere seconds to them.
His split blood flowed rivers and oceans onto our world.
And from this blood, we were born.”
These titans fought each other for leadership over the other titans. They have godly sight, being able to see each individual creature. They fight for leadership to guide the universe into particular evolution. wielding impossible weapons and tools made of mana. Some Elven believers say that the clashing of the god swords was the spark of life.

Titanic Spirits
“We had to come from something. If that whole godblood thing is true, then spirits of all shapes and sizes ran right out those veins.”

Spirits roamed the world, shaping it as it is. These spirits adapted over time, becoming one with the land. The spirits are the basis for all landforms, all religions, and are the ancestors of all the races.

Changelings of the World
The first sentient beings, the proto-man. They resemble the spirits that they call their ancestors, slightly glowing in light. They could change their shape, but not their size; unlike their spirit ancestors.

The Fox God of the Beastmen
Rather than constantly change what they were, some changelings permanently took the form of the animals that we see today. The Beastmen are the linked between the changelings and the flora and fauna. Most Beastmen pray to the Rabbit God, a spirit that is responsible for the then high population of the Beastmen. They also worship their totem animal. 

Giants: The Children of Titans
The Giants believe that their ancestors were not spirits or changelings, but rather the last surviving titan couple. They have 6 fingers and round ears, unlike the elves. Because of their culture and location, Giants stayed in their Stone age, working together to bring down massive beasts bigger than them.

Elves of the Land
Elves believe that their ancestors were spirits that prospered in peaceful times. As such, they did not need to constantly change, and were fine with the form that they are now. This is why they can use magic, the ability of the spirits. They lead long lives, up to 1000 years.

Fairies of another Realm
So different from the Beastmen, the giants, Fairies are small sentient beings that resemble elves, save for their four wings and their intelligence to use the magic around them rather than within them. Fairies that use the magic within them have shorter lifespans than those that use the magic within the flora and fauna. Due to their size, they were often preyed upon by common animals. Elves used to associate fairies with the realm of spirits, thinking such small creatures can only exist in a place outside of reality.
The fairies had a symbiotic relationship with the Elves, at first indirectly. In both their histories, there is legend of the first friendship between them, which gave birth to magic that could heal.

The First War
The Giants were constantly at war with the beastmen for territory and food source. It was the beastmen first that contacted the elves, enslaving them in hopes of using their magical abilities. Resilient elves were used as living shields in their war against the giants. It is said that the elves betrayed the fairies. Tribes of beastmen would drink elven blood in hopes of gaining their strength. Through the elves, beast men made use of the fairies. Much like the way the fairies used the world’s mana, the beastmen grinded fairies up for their potions and combat magic.

The war transpired for many generations. This dwindled the population of all races, especially the elves and the fairies.

The Pendragon Lineage
Legends of an Elf bearing the name Pendragon. He was the one who organized battle tactics that freed his elven people and the Fairies. Together, the Elven-Fairy Collective created a magic-based technological society that kept the Beastmen/Giant Aggregate and the rampant spirits at bay. Pendragon was also able to use the wandering spirits in their favor.

Pendragon was said to be the first king. They used magic as the vehicle that enabled the invention of advanced weapons. But the giants and the beastmen had their own scholars, adapting to the technology of their former slaves.

As if the planet was fighting back, corrupted spirits born from the pollution rose, destroying the societies of both sides. 

This violence lasted for 800 years with the occasional unofficial ceasefires and broken truces. This is how they managed to follow the elves and the fairies across space. They had evolved from their stone age counterparts into a rough warrior society that could reverse engineer the Elven-Fairy Collective’s technology. The constant arms race created pollution that made monstrosities of the flora and fauna. Records of giant plants that swallowed giants whole. Forests were burned down, Landforms decimated for the sake of strategic positioning. The world became sludge as both sides used the land’s materials to feed the war machine.

Home Among the Stars
The Elven-Fairy Collective did what they had to do to survive as a species, faced against the strength of the Giants and the Beastmen.  They poisoned oceans, killed off the main food supply of the giants and the beastmen. They survived off the advanced elven agriculture technology. The mana that was meant for the natural world had become tainted with war. The trees that the beastmen cut down would grow back, devoid of color and mana. By the time the Elven-Fairy collective had the technology and the means to leave their planet, it was already corrupted beyond repair.

The Beastman-Giant Aggregate’s plan was to follow the Elven-Fairy Collective to a new world. The First World had already been lost to pollution and the wild, untamed spirits that rose up to protect it. Both sides loaded up a fleet of ships to not only fight each other but to carry as much supplies as they could for the trip.

Centuries had passed since the four races left the First World. The two factions fought off world numerous times while collecting supplies. Food and ship fuel is getting scarce for the Aggregate. They cannibalized their ships and population until only the largest ship, the Ark, survived. The Aggregate knew that if they stopped following the collective, both their species would starve in a defunct starship. There was no turning back. Infighting had broken some of the auxiliary systems of the ship, such as their planetary scanner. Without it, they could not scan a planet for a life-supporting environment. They followed the Elven-Fairy Collective from a distance until the Elves and the Fairies discovered a planet that had life on it. 

They named this planet Artheria.

Legend has it that on these ships, the last remaining pure spirits of the old world stowed away. They were known as the Fey. It was the only explanation they had for the magical phenomena that took place as the Elves and Fairies adapted to their new home. Elves once again felt the presence of their old gods within the lands.

Half-Men of Artheria
The Elves and the Fairies met the Halflings; a collective of sentient creatures with various lifestyles. These cultures were known as Gnomes, Dwarves, or just Halflings. Halflings then, were in their bronze age.
Halflings shared to the elves and fairies that the land is filled with elemental monsters and strange creatures that originate from The Grand Beholder. The Grand Beholder being a strange, fleshy floating creature with one giant eye and smaller eyes on stalks. There is only one.

To the West, giant reptiles with wings that can breathe the elements. Entire villages have been razed to the ground, lo

Decades had passed after the Collective made first contact with the Halflings. Then the Giants and the beastmen landed. When the collective informed the halflings about their enemy. The collective tells them that their enemy’s technology could bring down ‘entire worlds’ upon Artheria (referring to their homeship, but lost in translation). This knows this, because the Collective can do so as well.

The Roaming Elementals

Era of Ice
Years -2000 to 2000
4000 Years of Ice

The Great War lasted until the Era of Ice. Temperatures dropped, freezing soldiers solid in the winter months. The average temperature for the summer months, in the middle of the day, was 60F degrees. This meant that during Autumn,the temperature range for the 3 months of the season would be -10F to 30F. During winter, it would be -60F to 0F degrees for all three months. To be without fire for more than half of the year meant certain death. The fight for supremacy became a fight for survival. Many cultures made a ceremony for Summer and fire, often incorporating a bonfire of some sort.

Frozen Struggle
The era of ice drove everyone to desperation. The cultural nature of the giants to enslave became their downfall, as the other races banded together to genocide them. This was done by ‘destroying their Ark’. Shortly after, every race fought each other for the last remaining sources of food. It was here that the entire planet slowly lost access to the ancient technology that their ancestors created. The peace between the elves and the halflings ended.This was the last time anyone saw a giant, presumed extinct by the forces of nature. Fairies, due to their size, could not survive long. They too, disappeared from the textbooks of history.

Search for the Chalice of the Gods
There was a search for Godblood, stirred by the legends of the old world. Legends of a king ascending to godhood, and a prince that could never attain the title of king due to missing the Godden Chalice.
A kind of technology that was lost, along with the techniques of ;those before them’. A Chalice contained this godblood,and brave explorers traveled outside into the frozen wastes to find it. They say the chalice could end the Era of Ice. This period of desperation caused the destruction of much of the technology that came from the ancestors. All throughout Artheria are ruins and dilapidated structures. Adventures are sometimes tasked to go to these places to recover lost artifacts.

The Humans
The Elves began to give birth to elves with rounded ears. They lived short lives like beastmen, not even 1/10th of their Elven parents, who lived up to 1000 years.
 These humans were cast out from their Elven society, as they could not use magic. They created their own society from stone, with the help of the Halfling people. It was in this period that Humans and halflings discovered electricity. They thought it to be this world’s form of magic. This new discovery led to the founding of the ‘Library of the Wise’.

Humans for a time worshiped the same gods that the Elves did. Over time, the deities that they worshiped changed names as humans began to spread across the Caerne Continent. 
The Church of the First
9 Parts
Origin of the First
The Church of the First is a religion that can be traced to when humans were cast out from Elven society. It is believed that from a pantheon of Gods, there was Ein, the first. He was a winged creature that broke away from the corruption of his brothers and sisters. There was involvement of the Godsbath, thorns, wings and rings of protection. Gods of this pantheon must travel in pairs.

Ein chose the form of a mortal man, depicted as a human. He traveled the Caerne continent, doing good, improving the lives of fellow humans.

He believed that being human was to be the best for other humans, saving children from the unknown terrors of the night.

Traditions involve linking with others, being of service to them.

Higher forms of religion practice a yearly ritual of proving to their partner that they are still of service to each other.
In some cases of day to day practice, some humans are not able to help each other. This angers some higher members of the faith.

Symbols of the faith often take forms of Golden wings, rings, and a sacred blue fire.
Followers of the faith find that they can heal others with golden flames.

Attributing it to their elven heredity, Their collective belief in their deity gave them the elvish ability to use magic, but only as collectives. This began religion that eventually spread to other human societies. This behavior was not observed by the other races.

It was around this time that humans founded Nepenthe, a self-sufficient island. 

Birth of the Orcs
What humans lacked in their magical ability, they made up with by their intellect. Humans studied the books of the Fairies, learning to harness the world around them. In an attempt to regain the elven power, they dabbled in what the Fairies called ‘Ash Magic’. This tainted the humans, creating subhumans. They were called ‘Orcs’. 

Like their elven relatives, the humans casted orcs out of their society due to their aggressive behavior, large tusks and olive green skin. Or so the humans. Say.
There is speculation that what really happened was that the orcs were used as a labor source. Realizing their strength, they gathered together and rebelled, traveling far from the humans and started their own society.

The first orcs were not dumb, but their aggressive nature made their integration into human society difficult.

Inserted Jan 4th 2024 by Mike: The Orcish Confederation
(Spin off from British-American Confederation because I’m doing homework about it.)
Sick of the Humans and their impossible work quotas, the orcs took over a colony. Humans with Ashen magic tried to control them but they fought back.

They drew up something called the Oxen Union. It was the 6 colonies banding together as a new nation. They broke free from human king control.

House of Humies
The Greyskins
Rockraiders
Bloodflags
Ochre Ogres
Steelmills

Each Union had a leader, who was usually the strongest orc in the colony.

They gathered their plans.

“Orcs have to work for 18 hours a day? Fuck that.”

The Oxen Union Post:
We can make ambassadors that speak for the union leader. And treaty with other governments (even the humans) and the natives (the halflings)

The Post had 13 Notes:
We’re the Orc Confederation
The Colonies have powers not listed here
Colonies help each other in battle
Colonies can travel to and fro. Crimers get sent back for trial.
Each colony gets a vote. Can send a band to participate as envoys.
The 6 Colonies work with other allies.
Colonies pick their best fighter leader and draw them on a board.
Each colony makes a tribute to the confederation
Only the Confederation can make war and peace. They assign the ambassadors.
 The Green Ones: They act as the Elders when the Elders can ‘t make good choices.
Humans can join.
 Confederation will pay for past war debts (towards the elves for their assistance)
These 12 Notes can be changed if all 6 colonies voted unanimously.

There was no national army so the power was useless.
Separate from Militia (Monsters kept attacking the colonies.)



They can declare war

They make their own currency

Settle colony disputes

They traded with halflings since they’re the natives of the planet.

After some years, there was colony tension.
Some populations went up, yet that area only got the one vote for the Conferation. (Orcs couldn’t pronounce Confederation)
There was no judges so most disputes were duels
The orc confederation was just weak due to the articles imposed on itself.

Colonies made colony trades, but didn’t involve the Confederation. They lost funding, hence power.
Human goods were cheaper, so orc good makers and the economy suffered.

Reform was needed.

Some of the colonies were growing at incredible pacing. 
The Choice Room became 2 Choice room. 1 room for the 2-7 representatives to choose to select the one for the next Judgement room. The ‘voice’ would be the voice for a few moons, seasons.

A foolish orc said to continue the current system. His voice was removed.

Someone said to combine the best of the two ideas.

Stupider sentients were being used as slaved. They were considered 2/5th a person.






Tieflings: Of Demons and the Deep
The Orcs that were cast out from human society returned in large numbers. There was rage from being created, only to be shunned. A war between humans and orcs began. They burned down the Library of the Wise. Now known as the Ruined Library. A human scholar who could trace their lineage back to Pendragon, used his wealth and the last of Fairies Knowledge to summon a creature from another world to fight the orc invasion. It was known as The Patron, a being that spoke from the shadows in empathetic whispers.

A promise was made. The Scholar known as Pendragon agreed to this pact. This ‘demon’ would keep his family warm from the cold of the Era of Ice, and would give them the power of the elves, for a great price. 

The First Pact
This promise threw the world in disarray. Portals to other worlds began to open. The sun was blotted out in gray smoke for days. The Scholar realized what the smoke really was; the release of beings from the previous world.  Inexplicable events began to happen all across the continent, potentially the world. Events such as monstrosity citings, increased frequency of natural disasters, ect.  Some say that The Patron took this chance to bring its siblings into the world. A bedtime story once told to scare children is known as The Birth of the Possessor Demon, an occult explanation of some animals acting odd, hunting larger predators despite the animal in question obviously suffering fatal wounds.

That specific event was named:
“The Promise that Shattered the World”.

To this day, no one knows just how many demons were released by The Patron, or how many. Two portals have shown to be of benefit to peaceful society; The Fire Genasi Portal, and the Strixhaven Portal. Sentient beings known as ‘Fire Genasi’ emerged from their portal. They became citizens of Amethyst Peak. Their portal is well protected by the Royal Fire Brigade.

The scholar became the First Warlock to The Patron, summoning spirits from another reality from his tome of spells. The Human-Orc war ended, thanks to his immense power. Pendragon was hailed a hero for being instrumental to the war. He enjoyed the life of a celebrity, attending major events in human history. 9 months after the war was over, Pendragon disappeared.

The scholar sired many children during his time as a celebrity. News of his firstborn child emerged, it shocked the entire human race. It looked like a beastman but something else entirely with purple skin. Every single woman that the scholar was involved with gave birth to monsters that looked like the firstborn. Some of the women showed no signs of pregnancy until the last month of the Scholar’s appearances.

In some cases, these hundreds of scholar mothers were found strangled to death with what looked like a fiery, ever moving bruise around their necks and a weapon of some kind close to their monstrous children.

Over time, the mothers shared that these children seemed to be protected by a dark magic that they found nauseating and chilling, as if they were standing naked in the cold of the Era of Ice, sick from eating rotten porridge.
It was only on their child’s coming into adulthood that they felt this chill touch end.
One mother admitted to fearing their child, and managing to kill them in their sleep after her first period, when the chill touch had gone.

The children banded together after a few reports of their deaths. They felt a calling, moving into an underground mining cave that their father once used as a practice area. There, they founded their own town.

All tieflings can trace their lineage back to the first warlock.

The Patron also brought in a new school of magic never before seen; Necromancy. Most humanoids have seen elven magic similar to tieflings such as summoning fire, But never had they seen the atrocity of a dead creature come back to life.
