### Home Among the Stars
The Elven-Fairy Collective did what they had to do to survive as a species, faced against the strength of the Giants and the Beastmen.  They poisoned oceans, killed off the main food supply of the giants and the beastmen. They survived off the advanced elven agriculture technology. The mana that was meant for the natural world had become tainted with war. The trees that the beastmen cut down would grow back, devoid of color and mana. By the time the Elven-Fairy collective had the technology and the means to leave their planet, it was already corrupted beyond repair.

The Beastman-Giant Aggregate’s plan was to follow the Elven-Fairy Collective to a new world. The First World had already been lost to pollution and the wild, untamed spirits that rose up to protect it. Both sides loaded up a fleet of ships to not only fight each other but to carry as much supplies as they could for the trip.



Centuries had passed since the four races left the First World. The two factions fought off world numerous times while collecting supplies. Food and ship fuel is getting scarce for the Aggregate. They cannibalized their ships and population until only the largest ship, the Ark, survived. The Aggregate knew that if they stopped following the collective, both their species would starve in a defunct starship. There was no turning back. Infighting had broken some of the auxiliary systems of the ship, such as their planetary scanner. Without it, they could not scan a planet for a life-supporting environment. They followed the Elven-Fairy Collective from a distance until the Elves and the Fairies discovered a planet that had life on it. 

They named this planet Artheria.

Legend has it that on these ships, the last remaining pure spirits of the old world stowed away. They were known as the Fey. It was the only explanation they had for the magical phenomena that took place as the Elves and Fairies adapted to their new home. Elves once again felt the presence of their old gods within the lands.


### Half-Men of Artheria
The Elves and the Fairies met the Halflings; a collective of sentient creatures with various lifestyles. These cultures were known as Gnomes, Dwarves, or just Halflings. Halflings then, were in their bronze age.
Halflings shared to the elves and fairies that the land is filled with elemental monsters and strange creatures that originate from The Grand Beholder. The Grand Beholder being a strange, fleshy floating creature with one giant eye and smaller eyes on stalks. There is only one.

To the West, giant reptiles with wings that can breathe the elements. Entire villages have been razed to the ground, lo

Decades had passed after the Collective made first contact with the Halflings. Then the Giants and the beastmen landed. When the collective informed the halflings about their enemy. The collective tells them that their enemy’s technology could bring down ‘entire worlds’ upon Artheria (referring to their homeship, but lost in translation). This knows this, because the Collective can do so as well.


### Era of Ice
The Great War lasted until the Era of Ice. Temperatures dropped, freezing soldiers solid. The fight for supremacy became a fight for survival.

### Frozen Struggle
The era of ice drove everyone to desperation. The cultural nature of the giants to enslave became their downfall, as the other races banded together to genocide them. This was done by ‘destroying their Ark’. Shortly after, every race fought each other for the last remaining sources of food. It was here that the entire planet slowly lost access to the ancient technology that their ancestors created. The peace between the elves and the halflings ended.This was the last time anyone saw a giant, presumed extinct by the forces of nature. Fairies, due to their size, could not survive long. They too, disappeared from the textbooks of history.
Search for the Chalice of the Gods
There was a search for Godblood, stirred by the legends of the old world. A Chalice contained this godblood,and brave explorers traveled outside into the frozen wastes to find it. They say the chalice could end the Era of Ice. This period of desperation caused the destruction of much of the technology that came from the ancestors.

### The Humans
The Elves began to give birth to elves with rounded ears. They lived short lives like beastmen, not even 1/10th of their Elven parents. These humans were cast out from their Elven society, as they could not use magic. They created their own society from stone, with the help of the Halfling people. It was in this period that Humans and halflings discovered electricity. They thought it to be this world’s form of magic. This new discovery led to the founding of the ‘Library of the Wise’.

Humans for a time worshiped the same gods that the Elves did. Over time, the deities that they worshiped changed names as humans began to spread across the Caerne Continent. 

There is a 

Attributing it to their elven heredity, Their collective belief in their deity gave them the elvish ability to use magic, but only as collectives. This began religion that eventually spread to other human societies. This behavior was not observed by the other races.

It was here that humans founded Nepenthe, a self-sufficient island. 


### Birth of the Orcs
What humans lacked in their magical ability, they made up with by their intellect. They studied the books of the Fairies, learning to harness the world around them. In an attempt to regain the elven power, they dabbled in what the Fairies called ‘Ash Magic’. This tainted the humans, creating subhumans. They were called ‘Orcs’. 

Like their elven relatives, the humans casted orcs out of their society due to their aggressive behavior, large tusks and olive green skin. The first orcs were not dumb, but their aggressive nature made their integration into society difficult. Only a few orcs were saved from exile.

### Tieflings: Of Demons and the Deep
The Orcs that were cast out from human society returned in large numbers. There was rage from being created, only to be shunned. A war between humans and orcs began. They burned down the Library of the Wise. Now known as the Ruined Library. A human scholar who could trace their lineage back to Pendragon, used his wealth and the last of Fairies Knowledge to summon a creature from another world to fight the orc invasion. It was known as The Patron, a being that spoke from the shadows in whispers.

A promise was made. The Scholar known as Pendragon agreed to this pact. This ‘demon’ would keep his family warm from the cold of the Era of Ice, and would give them the power of the elves, for a great price. 

This promise threw the world in disarray. Portals to other worlds began to open. The sun was blotted out in gray smoke for days. The Scholar realized what the smoke really was; the release of beings from the previous world.  Inexplicable events began to happen all across the continent, potentially the world. Events such as monstrosity citings, increased frequency of natural disasters, ect.  Some say that The Patron took this chance to bring its siblings into the world. A bedtime story once told to scare children is known as The Birth of the Possessor Demon, an occult explanation of some animals acting odd, hunting larger predators despite the animal in question obviously suffering fatal wounds.

That specific event was named “The Promise that Shattered the World”.



The scholar became the First Warlock to The Patron, summoning spirits from another reality from his tome of spells. The Human-Orc war ended, thanks to his immense power. Pendragon was hailed a hero for being instrumental to the war. He enjoyed the life of a celebrity, attending major events in human history. 9 months after the war was over, Pendragon disappeared.

The scholar sired many children during his time as a celebrity. News of his firstborn child emerged, it shocked the entire human race. It looked like a beastman but something else entirely with purple skin. Every single woman that the scholar was involved with gave birth to monsters that looked like the firstborn. Some of the women showed no signs of pregnancy until the last month of the Scholar’s appearances.

In some cases, these hundreds of scholar mothers were found strangled to death with what looked like a fiery, ever moving bruise around their necks and a weapon of some kind close to their monstrous children.

Over time, the mothers shared that these children seemed to be protected by a dark magic that they found nauseating and chilling, as if they were standing naked in the cold of the Era of Ice, sick from eating rotten porridge.
It was only on their child’s coming into adulthood that they felt this chill touch end.
One mother admitted to fearing their child, and managing to kill them in their sleep after her first period, when the chill touch had gone.

The children banded together after a few reports of their deaths. They felt a calling, moving into an underground mining cave that their father once used as a practice area. There, they founded their own town.

All tieflings can trace their lineage back to the first warlock.

The Patron also brought in a new school of magic never before seen; Necromancy. Most humanoids have seen elven magic similar to tieflings such as summoning fire, But never had they seen the atrocity of a dead creature come back to life.

### The Iceless Frontier: For Aevelon
The Era of Ice lasted something like 4000 years. When the humans were systematically cast out from elven society, they were just entering their copper age. Stories passed that someone had found the Chalice and used it to purify the world. The Era of Ice ended, beginning an era of relative peace.

The Halflings, Elves, Humans, Orcs, Tieflings and Beastmen began to intermingle and trade on the only discovered continent called Caerne. The Tria Prima was created, with the united manpower of all participating races. By this time, the Medieval Age began. Ranlean, Aralon and Amethyst Peak were founded.

War did return to Caerne, centuries later. The Orcish population proliferated faster than the other races. Orcs found that their bloodline was faulty. Orc women all over their society began to have children with degenerative traits. They cast out these defective, smaller orcs. These smaller orcs returned like pests. They are now known as goblins. Like their Orc ancestors, their population grew exponentially, until they could be found raiding hamlets throughout the land.

They began to seek answers for their stillbirths and the goblin disaster from the colleges. Their history with the humans as well as their predatory physique made their society untrusted throughout the land. Their population began to degenerate. Their society fell apart, fracturing into smaller societies until they became tribes of raiders and pirates. Tiefling societies were the first to be consistently raided.

 A bloodline of orcs that retained their intelligence became the nobles of their society, forced to lead their feral brothers and sisters until they can solve their degenerating gene issue.

The Tiefling-Orc War was the catalyst for the Adventurer’s Guild. At first, it was a call to arms for mercenaries to fight for the Tieflings, but in time converted to a guild that sent agents out for profit. They specialize in war contracting, exploration and asset recollection.

The Adventurer’s guild is actively searching for the Chalice that was said to have ended the Era of Ice. It is said to reside in a place called Aevelon.

The Guild has also dispatched many adventurers to unexplored continents, but no adventurer has yet to return.
