At the Moment, there is one Patron. The very same patron that brought upon the Promise that Shattered the World. The Patron, coming from a world of pain and suffering, has adjusted to Artheria. No longer does it feel the constant burning of its home plane.

The Patron took the form of a giant tentacle creature, its tentacles moving autonomously in response to any kind of pain and suffering. Just the emotional sense placed light pressure in the mana fields. The tentacles would seek to destroy before whatever the threat destroyed the Patron.

At first, The Patron laid a trail of destruction, as it was all it knew. It was its form of communication. But the patron would lose its strength. It needed rest.

The Patron learned to control its tentacles, watching soldiers pause and relax before engaging in warfare. It learned to control its destructive impulses. It was pleasant, simply not doing anything.

Creatures from the Patron’s plane fed through consuming the mana off each other. With the introduction of a pause in combat, the Patron also wondered what the effects of not feeding,

Some soldiers managed to remove portions of the Patron. It made the patron smaller. With every episode of fighting, the patron was getting smaller and smaller. And as it did, The hunger lessened. 

WIth this knowledge, The Patron began to experiment with how much of himself he could lose.

As per his agreement with the scholar, He was tasked to end the war. Using a great flame, he burned large portions of himself to create the Dark Fog. It smelt of rotten burning flesh. It stopped the Orcs from advancing. The Dark Fog had the Patron’s part that enabled his regenerative abilities. He could absorb this place back at any time, but chose to leave it in a dungeon.

The next thing he did was remove its giant eye. The eye was large. It acted as the center where his flesh would recollect.
Forgotten Eye. (Heart?)

The mana required to remove these things from itself was massive. The Patron was now the size of any sentient.Using the very magic that the other beings were using in this world, The Patron cast a spell on itself to take the form of a human. It learned the ways of humans. It learned many things.This was an excursion of years.

The Patron’s efforts and the help of his siblings enabled the orc war to end.



With the Orcs fought off and the war ended, The Patron’s task was done. He was to go back to his plane of suffering. This, he did not like. The Patron put the remainder of its mana into a spellbook. He had become fond of using magic. The spellbook acted as his journal. The Patron’s Spellbook.

Pacts take a toll on both parties. The Scholar was dying, the pact continuing to sap his energy. The Scholar was growing older at a rapid pace. He sent out adventurers to find the Patron. The Patron was eventually caught. After the creation of its spellbook, It was too weak to reabsorb the Dark Fog, nor its heart or its Spellbook.

WIth the last of his energy, the Scholar had prepared a Banishment Spell. It took the form of a wooden axe.

This Banishment would absorb the Patron, giving its life essence to the caster.

Before the Banishment Spell could be successful, the Patron tricked the Scholar. The Scholar himself was banished into the Patron’s realm of pain and suffering. The Patron absorbed him. He also absorbed his age, and the fading mana of the Scholar. However many years the Scholar had, the Patron had left. The Patron was now mortal.

The Patron lived the rest of its life out as a mortal human woman. The attempted banishment, as well as the Patron being split into 4 total parts messed with its passing away. 

The Patron then met Kavik. An Adventurer. Kavik was hungry for power. The Patron gave it to him. But it warned Kavik that the price for the power was pain and suffering. It is the price for its power. Invisible tentacles would sap and facilitate the pain of suffering of not only Kavik but those around him. Kavik would not listen.

The Patron’s body passed away. But its essence was transferred into Kavik’s essence. A deal was made. Kavik would enable The Patron to enjoy a life of adventure through his eyes, his senses. Because the Patron could not do this. The Patron could not explore the peace that this world had to offer.

Whenever Kavik needed to talk to the Patron, he was tapping into the eye. 

Kavik then became a renowned adventurer. Kavik had a son. Kazka.

The Scholar’s community learned of the failed banishment. They began to hunt Kavik down to extract the Patron from him.

Wanting Kazka to be more powerful than him, Kavik passed the Patron over to him. The cost of the transfer being Kavik’s own passing shortly later. Kazka then went on to become an adventurer like his father, unknowing of who the Patron really was.

The Patron
From an unfathomable realm of agony, suffering, and perpetual devastation, the Patron was summoned into existence. This ethereal entity, akin to a spirit, possessed the ability to alter its form at will. Its essence exuded a trinity of mana, radiating hues of green, purple, and red. Manifesting as a dark mass, intertwined with an array of fiery colors, it bore horns and tails.
Upon entering the realm of Artheria, the Patron found respite from ceaseless torment. This new world appeared akin to a paradisiacal haven. Endowed with telekinetic powers, the Patron possessed the uncanny ability to discern the intentions of other living beings. Instead of relying on verbal discourse, it communicated through emotions, as such was the custom within its original plane. Communication there thrived solely through the language of annihilation, destroy or be destroyed.
The summoning of this entity into the mortal realm was the work of The Scholar, a human wizard who delved into forbidden fairy lore. The Patron was brought forth with the purpose of safeguarding humanity from the merciless onslaught of the Orcs, who sought to inflict genocide upon their kind. The Patron's native realm was perpetually engulfed in an invisible inferno, which the Scholar harnessed to provide warmth to the humans during the Era of Ice.
Initially, the Scholar restrained the Patron with ethereal chains, endeavoring to establish communication with the colossal spirit. Once a dialogue could be established, the Scholar forged a pact, communicating through the medium of emotions.
The agreement was struck. In exchange for the Patron's formidable abilities, the Scholar committed to maintaining the presence of the being in the mortal realm, safeguarding the gates through which it had entered for as long as possible.
At least, that was the Scholar's understanding.
The Patron harbored reservations. and mistrust towards the diminutive creature and its immense power, deceived the Scholar.
The pact was sealed, yet the price to sustain the gates cursed the bloodline of the Scholar for generations to come. The once clear skies became shrouded in a somber gray hue, not from smoke but from an unending swarm of lesser demons hailing from the Patron's abode.
On that fateful day, the Orcish war came to an abrupt halt. Their numbers decimated by the relentless onslaught of the demons that descended upon them. When the orcs finally relented, the demons sought to remain in this newfound paradise.
The exact method employed by the Scholar to banish the demons remains shrouded in mystery. Nonetheless, the Scholar managed to accomplish this feat, albeit leaving two portals in their wake: the Strixhaven portal and the Fire Genasi portal. Nevertheless, the damage had been done. Inexplicable events began to unfold across the world, with reports of nightmarish creatures spreading chaos, death, and madness.
The fate of the Patron after the pact's inception remains unknown.
To this day, people refer to this cataclysmic event as "The Promise that Shattered the World."
