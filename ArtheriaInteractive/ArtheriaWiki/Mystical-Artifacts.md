And Other such Magic Treasures and Items
Orcish Sword
(Yoshua)
Discovered in Dryadâ€™s Ruins (S2)
Elf Bleed


The sword is made from pig iron. It is rough, uneven. As if the blade was rushed. Has a shimmer of what looks like broken glass along the sharpened blade. The blade vibrates slightly in the presence of anyone with elvish ancestry (high, wood or dark elf.)

There are 8 scores etched by the hilt of the blade.

(Inflicts additional 1d6 damage to elves)

Destroyed by Elves as an offering to their Elven God. Yoshua lost it. Stated by Mikey since the campaign was on indefinite hiatus.
Elven Ring
(Elikaen)
Taken from the Dryad (S2)
Spirit of the Tool


Green Gem inlay
Dark wood ring with 2 silver lines

Used to be bigger, it seems. Part of a wand or rod of some sort.

Draws upon the charm of ancient gods to manifest the soul of an object, awakening it. The ring takes the stored mana within the gem and spends it, breaking the gem. The mana is then channeled through the weave, returning back to the gods.

Destroyed, used to create the Rod of Absorption. Stated by Mikey since the campaign was on indefinite hiatus.
