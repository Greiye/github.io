# Amethyst Peak

[[Cities-and-Towns]]
## History
Known as the City of Dragons, Amethyst Peak is a kingdom that sits atop Artheria's tallest volcano. It was founded by Anarch, the Deity of Lachesism, thousands of years ago. The location was home to an abundance of dragons, which Anarch associated with absolute power after witnessing the magic possessed by the Elder Dragons of Arcavios. He aimed to tame these dragons in an attempt to harness their magic.

## The Populace
It is home to many Fire Genasi and Dragon Descendants.
Mostly humans, a few elves. Dragonborn.


## The Kingdom: From a one man village to a thriving Kingdom State.
A millennia later, though Anarch has since dropped his draconic venture, Amethyst Peak still reigns as a symbol of strength and power. Many have tried to overtake the kingdom and seize control of the dragons, but have all fallen to fearsome warriors.


## Kings, Then and Now


##### Previous Kings
### King Breitling


### The Ruling King
 The kingdom's current monarch is the Bardic King, Teofilo Blackthorn. He has earned the nickname, "Filo the Amoureux," due to his playboy antics. His charisma not only aided in his collection of lovers, but it also played a large role in the galvanization of his army. King Filo was a great swordsman with his rapier, but his true talent was his ability to inspire with his Sword Dancing. This ability, along with his natural leadership, earned him the position as king. Through his various escapades, he has amassed a number of lovers and it was clear that he was open-minded with his selection. 




### The Dragon Queen
The mother of his first child was Saphira Maleys, is a dragon who was polymorphed into a human. This resulted in his son, Lance, being born as a half-dragon. 

#### Draconic Birthright
Lance grew to be a great fighter who was labeled as the Dragon Knight of Amethyst Peak. Though he never acted like it, he was next in line to be king. Through his training with the military, Lance met Valka Tessarion, a talented dragon rider, and they had a daughter, whom they named Lancia.

#### Sexist Court
The kingdom's bigoted court was against the idea that if Lance were to become king, Amethyst Peak would eventually be ruled by a Queen with Lancia being his next of kin. They would much rather have King Filo's second son, Belial, be king since he has a son, Biliran. 

#### Fiery Romance
Belial's mother, Alpas Urere, was a flame elemental, which makes him a flame genasi. He wedded Eros Nefeli, an earth genasi and this is why Biliran is a lava para-genasi. Belial and Biliran are ruthless fighters who shared the same ideals as Anarch. They did not care about the collateral damage that resulted from their destructive and chaotic style of fighting. Because of this, Belial and Biliran were nicknamed the Hellflame and the Scorched-Earth Soldier, respectively.


#### Unknown to the Court, An Overthrowing Conspiracy
In order to prevent the future induction of a Queen on the throne, the kingdom's court had planned a conspiracy to kill Lance and his family. This would secure Belial 's seat as king where he could continue the kingdom's powerful reign. Lance grew wind of this and, for her protection, sent Lancia to Strixhaven to learn about her birthright and to train for her eventual fight for the throne with her cousin, Biliran. 

#### Envoy of the Castle in Education.
On her way to the school Lancia, the true heir to the throne, learns that her parents had passed away and she had become the Daughter of the Uncrowned King.

Mikey Notes:
“The Academy is a fine institution, but does not offer the same cultural enrichment afforded by the other bodies of education. Henceforth, Lancia will attend Strixhaven Academy as a gesture of diplomacy."



#### What is Lachesism?
The belief that strength comes from adversity. One should constantly put themselves in these tough situations.

### Miners

The town of Amethyst Peak has a stronghold. In the surrounding area there is a partially underground Volcanic cave system. Within the caverns, there are many dungeons, tombs and treasures.



## Outside the Walls
The area past the Mountain Area is home to Fire Elementals. Pele’s Playground is a secluded plain area with lava pools. Miners collect from the Sulfur Caverns and the Obsidian Mines.

Inside the walls is Castle Blackthorn, made mostly of obsidian and dragonglass. Around the castle is where the aristocrats and merchants live. The Church of Anarch is home to many worshippers. There are the Dragon Caves where various dragons are raised. Wild Dragons of all types live all throughout the range. The Scalene Sanctuary is where older dragons are taken care of, mostly by Anarch worshippers. The Adventurers’ Guild has a lounge here. Only in the Peak is where you’ll find Dragonglass Smiths. Amethyst Peak is wealthy. In most cities, craftsmen and armorers would be considered high class, but not in the peak. Ranchers and Hunters are considered middle class, but choose to stay outside the castle. The lower class are the peasants and the miners, living outside the castle.
The Stables hold the common horses and Dragonestrians, unique dragons that are similar to horses but have adapted to the lands.



You’ll also find the Dark Arts Clinic, the Tavern Hotel, and the Courtesan House, not to be confused with the common brothel.

## Obsidian
Amethyst Peaks’s economy is largely based on its export of Obsidian armors and swords. The most luxurious armaments being Dragonbreathe Crafted weapons. Another key export is Sulfur, which is also produced into Batteries for Ranlean. It can be made into Sulfuric Acid, Oil Refinement and Water Processing Products. For Aralon’s agriculture, sulfur can also be made into Fertilizer and Fungicide. In house it’s used for Mineral Extraction and to create poison gas. It was also used as a kind of fire weapon that could continue to burn in water, known as the Flames of Amnesty.

Aside from that, the Peak also exports meat to Aralon and Ranlean, specifically Goat, Lamb and Rabbit meat. Hunters gather Bear, Bobcat, Rodent and various cave dwelling animal meat at a higher price. Though the premium product is Dragon Meat. This meat is rare, as it’s collected from aging dragons that have passed away from natural means. A dragon is never killed for this purpose, as dictated by the Church of Anarch.


## Church of Anarch
Some Theology control
This Church pays homage to Anarch, the originial settler of the Peak.
Every part of the dragon is used, as to not waste the gifts of a dragon’s life. They are known to house an archive of knowledge from Anarch’s time.





Not far from the Peak is a town called Dragonglass. They export a mysterious glasslike mineral that can only be collected manually, using dragon scale or dragon bone. Previous attempts to mine dragonglass with traditional pickaxes have failed.


### Historic Stages
#### Village Stage
Anarch initially sought shelter in a cave. Later, they took over a dragon nest. A well was discovered, and a path was created to it. Close to the well, a hunting hut was built to hunt rabbits and goats for food. To manage waste, a Waste Pit was established away from the living area, across the crater.

#### Bandits came to pillage.
Bandits attacked, Anarch killed, and the surviving bandits were enslaved for cheap labor. A defensive wall was built around the crater to funnel bandits in one direction, with a hidden exit to attack from the walls. Dragons posed a threat, initially hiding and losing food, leading to starvation. As the workforce grew, better defenses were developed, including ballistae effective against some dragons. Attempts to capture dragons had mixed results, with most tamers getting burnt. A giant tower was constructed for early detection of dragons, and an army slowly amassed with craftsmen creating obsidian weapons. Advancing into the Iron Age, 'Dragon Shields,' wide metal shields, were crafted to protect against dragon breath.


#### Amethyst in the center of a crater.
Anarch dug deep in the crater. Limited supply.
The mines here became the safe place to escape the dragons.
Anarch’s life was questioned. Long life span is not normal.
Left this stage when it became self sufficient in a primitive way. The Peak began to trade.

### Town Stage 
Large Castle with a perimeter wall.

Trade begins.
Meet fire elementals
Fire elementals can’t mine.
Low oxygen. They suffocate.
That or gases make them explode
The explosion doesn’t kill them. It’s the collapse of the mine.
Trade rare elemental stuff for stone.
Start taming them.
Elemental materials good for fighting dragons.
Taming better. Dragon riders now available.
Erecting official Walls of Amethyst Peak.
Dragon Shields depreciated. Some melted to become weapons. Some still around.
Spare obsidian is grinded into powder and used in ceramics

Find something a town distance away.
This caught Anarch’s attention. It… felt different. Not normal.
Call it dragonglass. Unbreakable, but looks like scales. See through.

Meet people from Ranlean and Aralon.
Aralon people bring food. Vegetables. Supplement health. Longer lives.
Ranlean brings craftsmen. Use of magic.
Provide soldiers to them. Bandits don’t stand a chance.
Miraculous Trading, War never happens.
Anarch sees them as weaker than him. Not a challenge.
In this time, Anarch killed a talking dragon.

Long life span. People think Anarch is an elf. Maybe a god, for the less educated.
Town stage done.

### City Stage
1100 years had passed.
Dragonglass ‘town’ set up.
Underground levels are a prime place for giant pests. Unused since the Winged Threat’ Era, when dragons would randomly raid.

Castle walls not touched by an invading force ever. Dragon Riders the reason. Closest call was when Black Bay had destroyed their mining operation.

Now 3 layers of castle wall, expanded to protect the structures.
Center Castle Circle: Aristocrats and Soldiers and Dragon riders.
2nd Layer: Aristocrats, important buildings, craftsmen.

Anarch becomes a legend by this time. Life far expands an elf.

### Notable City Design
Large Watchtowers with Dragon Drops.
These drops were like ports that enabled 2 dragons to take off at the same time. 2 was the limit, accounting for the weight of battle dragons.

The City has about 10 of these drops.
The drops also had a beacon that was to be lit at the first sign of an invasion. Its first beacon was naturally the direction of the invasion force.

City has 5 drops inside the city. These housed the larger dragons (10 feet tall, 14 feet long)

There are 5 other drops outside of the city. These housed the smaller dragons (6 feet tall, 10 feet long)

The mountainous terrain makes for tired soldiers. Only way for them to invade was through the air. The flat routes were heavily guarded. Often there were underground pathways for the soldiers.

Waste Recycling Plants recycled water through steam and burnt the solid waste. This was a job done by the fire elementals as they had no sense of smell.

Fire Elementals use lava pools as their relaxation. It’s a swim in the pool for them.
They survive off of oxygen.
They require shelter from the rain.
They reproduce by releasing cinder seeds (Like dandelions)
They enjoy burning different materials. It’s like feeding them.
They are in a circle of life with other elementals.
Storm Elementals seek to absorb their essence.
They seek to absorb other essences as well.
Any magical creature ( like dragons) wants to eat their cores.


Town is covered in Ceramics made with obsidian powder.
-First fought the Fire Elementals. They made excellent workers in the area.
-Then captured weaker dragons. Hunted dragons for their scales
-Captured and enslaved bandits.
-Began trading.


Building Materials
Stone, Grey and Black.
Wood barely used, Low quantity, flammable.
Plenty of Scales and Bone.




## Culture

Prominent Colors
Black/Grey/White/Purple/Red/Orange/Yellow.
Obsidian, Dragonbreathe.

From Obsidian Ceramics.

Often Depicting Dragons in their culture.


A Fire Elemental Core



### A Sky of Dragons
The amount of dragons that Amethyst peak has can blot out the sun.
The issue here, is that only about 20% of them are military trained.

### A Family of Dragons
The Nobles of Amethyst Peak care for their dragons. 
A family often has a dragon assigned to each family member. As if by magical means, the dragons usually pass away shortly after their bonded owners.

### Dragon Ownership Licensure and Badges
To have a dragon is the ultimate form of citizenship. There are some ownership types that come with their own badge and paperwork:

License Level | Desc | Badge Color
-- | -- | --
Verified Solo Tamed | Highest Honor. This can only be given with the endorsement of an esteemed tamer and proctor. Both parties watch the person tame the dragon on their own. Long ago, Anarch was the one who proctored these tests. Often these tests led to honorable places in Anarch’s court. Verified Solos are often called by the Dragonguard as a Private Contractor. As such, they enjoy a city stipend for their work. |  dragon with Amethyst Inlay
Inherited | given to them by a family or friend, bearing both names of the giver and receiver. | Gold
Tamed | Given to someone when they tame the dragon on their own ability. They have to send out a declaration that they’ll go out and get one. There is potential for abuse here, as they may just buy it or cheat the system so that they tame one through dishonorable methods. | Silver
Issued | Given to military riders. They understand that their issued dragon is in their care, but that it was not tamed or inherited. They are approached by other dragon tamers in the riding dens often to see that the dragon is in good health. The topic of discussion is usually about the dragon, and not the riders themselves. The Dragon cannot develop a bond with the rider, in the event the rider dies or their contract expires. Military Dragons are switched out every year in rotation. | Copper.
No paperwork | Misc Possibly taken. Stolen at a young age. With no paperwork, People are skeptical as to how the rider obtained their dragon. They are avoided by everyone in Amethyst Peak. Even non-riders avoid them in the event that the local authorities see them together as potential accomplices.

## Dragon Care
The care of dragons is a priority in the city. Dragon with a glance can see if the dragon is eating well, how old they are, the strength of their bond. There is a single family of Scaluers in the city of Amethyst peak. They are well respected.

### Occasional Dragon Theft
Pet,Horse and Land Dragon theft occur. And very rarely Scout or Battle Dragons due to their bond. It is assumed that they are stolen for fresh dragon parts far from amethyst peak, or to forcefully bear dragon eggs. These rare occurrences happen only once every 10 years or so.


### Types of Dragons
#### Pet Dragons
Smaller than most humans. Large one is just as big. Pretty much pets. Live short lives. They are quite rare and intelligent, but do not win the respect of dragon riders. They are seen as parrots, pretty much.

#### Horse Dragons- odd dragons that can breathe a small amount of fire. Can be attached to carts or ridden on.

#### Scout Dragons - Rideable flyer dragons. Very fast. Very small bile bladders, so their breathes are limited. Account for 25% of the dragon populace., thus.

#### Land Dragons - Gigantic Dragons that resemble oxen. Their small wings are vestigial. They can’t fly. Used to carry large carts. Some land dragons are dragons with broken wings or can no longer fly.

#### Battle Dragons
The heart and soul of amethyst peak. Dragons that are used for fighting. Battle Dragons account for about 60% of the total Amethyst Peak dragon population. As such, Amethyst Peak is always war ready.

#### Drakes
Dragons that cannot breathe fire.

#### Talking Dragons
The first dragons, as met by Anarch.
In Anarch's journal entries, he states that these talking dragons were extremely dangerous. No partnership can be formed by them. Although they know how to speak, Anarch has noted that this is just a tool for them. They have learned the common tongue just to lower the defenses of their prey.

The speculation is that some dragons captured sentients, to eat them at a later time. Being creatures that are capable of delayed gratification, they may have learned to mimic speech from this.

Little is known of these talking dragons. Some even say that they never existed; That it was a fiction made by Anarch to scare his opponents. Some assert that the bones that hang over the throne are fakes.

Anarch was said to have killed the last talking dragon, but that, much like the idea of talk dragons, is questioned.


Dragons Populace Percentage
Pet - 1
Horse - 10
Scout - 25
Land - 4
Battle - 60
Talking Dragons - 0

## Dragon Stages of Life
Egg - 1 year incubation period. They are kept warm in an incubator with high temperatures.

### Wyrmling -  When a dragon leaves their egg, they are known as wyrmlings. Their scales begin to take a color. They require a lot of care and attention, needing an older dragon as a parental figure. Introduction to sentients is key in this stage of life. A wyrmling not socialized at this point in time will grow to see sentients as a food source, and not a symbiotic partner.

Wyrmlings can occasionally breathe fire, but it’s uncontrolled. Hence, why scale nurseries exist. Often they hurt themselves as they don’t have the technique learned.

### Young - A youngling reaches this age when they can at will, breathe fire and can fly for short bursts of time. This is usually when they’re trained for war.

### Adult - These dragons are fully grown, and at the height of their mobility. They serve on the dragon force until stated otherwise.
### Elder - You know they’re in their elder stages when you can see the graying edges of their scales, and their slower movements.

Oddly enough, the strength of their breath is strongest in this stage of life. 

Elder dragons are retired, and enjoy a life of peace with their families. There are some elder dragons still serving in the military.

### Passing/Funeral
Dragons close to passing have the inevitable weakening of their breathe. Fire breathers get cooler and cooler.

Dragons often adopt characteristics of their element.
The majority of fire breathing dragons keep a temperature of about 70C (154F). As such, Dragons are hot to the touch and their nests are often made for comfort, not to keep warm. Their lairs are usually somewhat charred. They enjoy rinsing in lava for brief periods of time. They do not bathe in the lava. Although these beasts are resistant to high temperatures, they are not immune to its melting point. High temperatures will soften the scales and reptilian hide.

Their ‘baths’ consist more of ‘fire grooming’, where the parent dragon breathes fire on their offspring periodically, until their bodies are free of debris.

Dragon fire breath is usually red/orange, some dragon fire burns blue. This is due to higher oxygen present in their bile organs. It is not known if this is a hereditary trait or one that comes from health habits.

Anarch’s dragon was known to have blue flame. But that is up to debate, as the documentation is poor. Any and all documents of Anarch are closely protected by the Church of Anarch, in their library catacombs.



In the case of the water breathing and acid breathing dragons:
Water breathing dragons are moist to the touch. They run a little hotter than humans, (105F). Their nests are usually damp.

The recorded water dragons that lived in Amethyst Peak required a lot more water than their other counterparts. As such, the owners had to live on ground level, creating artificial ponds for the dragons to bathe and rest in.

Acid Breathers are rare, but are heavily documented from this one example. Their lairs are usually caustic and hard to breathe in. nesting was hard to come by, often being melted within a season. As such, they usually tuck themselves into soft patches of dirt. Caretakers had suits made of glass that reflected the acidic breath.

### Dragonrider Association.
The Population of Dragons is heavily regulated, out of care for the dragons and their environment. A popular event is dragon riding, but time and time again, riders fall to their demise or are burnt.

#### Ownership/Paperwork Bureaucrats
Dragon Tamers/Riders and Riding Instructors
Dragon Den Architects
Dragon Care Specialists aka Scaluers.
Dragonbreathe Coexistence coordinators

Aristocrats had a right to a dragon den. This is why most aristocratic homes have spires built over them.


### Dragon’s Intelligence
Size and Intelligence are strongly correlated in Dragons.

Scout and Battle Dragons can get to be as smart as a 15 year old.. (Like Elephants)
It’s a common occurrence that these dragons wake people up, ask for food, and throw tantrums.
They give gifts such as cooked meats. They can paint and joke around by nibbling on their owner’s boots and other such mischievous behaviors.. They usually learn about 2000 words in their lifetime and can even associate images and read some text.

They develop friendships and communicate with other dragons. Some of them shoot fire and smoke in the air as a kind of communication. Some specialists see this as a kind of smoke signal language.

They usually disregard other humans/sentients, aside from those they see regularly. Very rarely is a dragon friendly. They have to be exposed to the new human in a course of a week, like horses, best at a young age..





### The Waterbreather, the Acid Breathe
Most Dragons in the Peak breathe fire, but a few can breathe different elements. These dragons are usually known by name, the deviance of the elements only being one or two in the whole kingdom's history.

Water breathing Dragons have been recorded in Amethyst Peak history. They were of great use before obsidian ceramics were declared necessary. There is speculation that there were 3 or 4 water breathing dragons in the past.
In the current generation, there are no water breathers.

An acid breathing dragon was recorded about 500 years ago. They were key in a battle maneuver where enemies were closed off in an area, but the surrounding trees were not set alight.

There was mention that this one specific acid dragon was troublesome. Due to its acid ability, it often melted obsidian  stone. The owner’s family home suffered severe damage. They relocated to an area outside the castle perimeter.

After this event, the same dragon was used to carefully destroy old buildings for renovation. The owner of this dragon later started a demolition business. Their family is doing well to this day.

### Knowledge of other breathe types
It is common knowledge that dragons can breathe fire. Only those that care about the topic know that there were other types of dragon breathe, such as water and acid.

It is not known if dragons can breathe past that. It may be possible that dragons can breathe ice.
There is a desire by the Dragon community to spot other dragons in different biomes, outside of the continent. But traveling to other continents is difficult. No known dragon can fly the distance required to reach landfall, (poor documentation of the continent to the north, aside from that it seems to always be snowing there.)


### The Dragon Skeleton
Above the throne is a dragon skeleton in completion. This is to show others that giant talking dragons were real, and that Anarch killed one in this very castle. It is the biggest dragon skeleton known to Amethyst Peak, at 60ft in length.

Hung above so that others can somewhat experience what it was like to fight something so grand.

The scales of the beast hang behind the throne.
The head directly over the throne.

Dragons give birth in litters of 1 or 2. Twin births are uncommon. They are the desired litter amount to keep the dragon population in check.


Drawbacks of a Dragon Populace
-Large Upkeep
-More frequent than normal fires
-Rider Deaths

### The Twins
Amethyst Peak Parents hope for twins and a twin dragon birth. In the current society, there is a twin set that is infamous for their dragonbond presentation. They act as envoys that follow after the ambassador.


### The Rampant Dragon
Legend says that there was a dragon that was abused and betrayed by their bond holder. This dragon did not die after their owner, and is said that it lived for the next 500 years, terrorizing the populace.


#### Giving Dragon Eggs
To be given a dragon is an amethyst peak honor. The families that prepare to give a dragon wyrmling or dragon egg away do heavy research, using resources to make sure that the wyrmling is cared for until it reaches riding age.

There is a giving ceremony, akin to marriage.

Lachesism. Growth through challenges. The good of Lachesism is that Amethyst Peak residents can be found doing incredible things within their area. Such as hiking up the many mountains in the Gemmis Mountain Range.

The Bad of Lachesism is that some bad actors take this as some sort of challenge. They may understand Anarch’s teachings as a call to anarchy, raiding people or being destructive due to ‘Anarch’s Teachings’.

As a result, people have a polarized view of the citizens of Amethyst Peak. They’re either extremely brave or extremely dangerous. 

### Anarch’s Court Structure


Level 1 - King
Level 2 - Prince/Princesses
Level 3 - Dukes
Level 4 - Marquis
Level 5 - Earls/Barons
Level 6 - Baronmen
Level 7 - Knights
Level 8 - Baron’s Sons/ People of Merit
Level 9 - Merchants and Tradesmen
Level 10 and Below - Common Citizens, Serfs

### Unique Laws
King’s Law of the Land
Whatever the King says goes.

#### Protection of the Dragons
The dragon association is the final say in all things dragon related.







### Relations with Ranlean and Aralon: The Alchemical Romance
Ranlean has been around for as long as Aralon and Amethyst Peak. With Ranlean being a leader in Magical Technology (Ranlean Tech), Amethyst usually trade with them for their innovations.


Aralon has been the most traditional of the Alchemical Romance. They find pride in the simple things. They grow delicious fruits and vegetables not traditionally found in the mountain ranges of Amethyst Peak.

Being known as a simple town, Aralon is a kind of neutral place of pilgrimage that many Amethyst Peak citizens go to. It serves as a place that does not see challenge as something to be overcome, but rather to be kept the same.

Occasionally, believers of Anarch and
