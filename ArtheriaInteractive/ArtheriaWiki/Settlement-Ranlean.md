# Ranlean
## The Town of Arcanic Development
Ranlean is known in the Western Caerne as the progressive technological marvel of Artheria. It boasts to be the cutting edge of the world’s technology. The first settlement to have an official social-republic government.

Citizens have access to the **Largest Library** in all of the Caerne continent. In the center of the library, there is a *Planetarium*. Protected by Ranlean’s Police Department (RPD). Has a hospital, and banking system. The streets are kept lit with lightbulbs, thanks to the mercury stores. They chiefly export technology and innovative products.
Has a lot of Strixhaven Graduates. Has some corruption with the Darkwaters.

One of their rarer fruits that grow only in Ranlean is *Ranlean Rhambutan*, a blue fruit with long hairlike growth. 

They pay homage to **Vellichor**, known by some as the great sage. 
The Town prizes education above all else.

## Ranlean’s Goal
Information is your greatest tool. The mind is a blade that is always concealed. It is the hammer and nails that stay in your hand. To prosper in destitution is the mark of a strong soul. One must bear an unworldly strength and indomitable will to truly live.
