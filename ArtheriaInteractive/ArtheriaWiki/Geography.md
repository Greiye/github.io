Silverpeak aka the Winterlands. It’s always frozen there.
Giant Wooly beasts traverse this area. Some speculate that monstrous mechanical entities can survive here.

The Hymlie Principality is the only society that has thought of exploring Silverpeak.

Called Silverpeak due to the giant mountain that sailors have spotted while sailing in the area. The mountain is so large that it cuts through the fog.



Hymlie Principality
Taiga / Desert
Richest Source of Magic

The place that has the most literature made. It’s said that starfarers settled in the continent and brought about what is now known as magic.

Called the principality due to the superstition of a prince ruling over the continent. In the legend, the prince never became a king, as it was required to sip from the Godden Chalice.The King of the World ascended to godhood, leaving his family behind.

The Prince ruled for eons but never found the chalice.
