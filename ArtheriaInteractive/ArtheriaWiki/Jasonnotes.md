Virasana needs
-Source of Economy
(Mikey's Take: The flora and fauna in the area are the town's main source of economy. Only the tribespeople have intimate knowledge of the area, only they know how to get these rare ingredients and materials from the land around them. A record of 3 Voltanica war parties have tried to collect the materials, even kidnapping the tribespeople to collect the material for them, only to fail to disease, weather, dangerous terrain and beast attacks. The animals remember the Voltanica raiding parties, so they avoid humanoids or attack them on site. This only increases the value of a tribesperson, as they can still collect materials with ease.

The beast themselves and the materials they create are unique and unmatched in the world. Leather hides from a certain animal are as tough as steel. organs that can be turned into health potions, mana potions that recover a spell slot].)

-The Town
(Mikey's Take: The village is one of the many settlements that the Vira Sana tribe frequent, as they are nomadic like native Americans. The town is a mixture of stone and wooden buildings built down into the land. The population is small. Some people stay all year, some migrate to the other Vira Sana villages with the seasons.

Most tribespeople listen to the Elders. [Maybe one of them is a highly regarded elf/dwarf due to the long life span? Maybe druidic? Liv is really into Paganism, and I've even made some gods for her. Maybe they believe in those.]

The town is self-sufficient, but they also see the benefit of trade. Not so much for gold, but bartering. They find modern luxuries incredible, so they often trade with adventurers.
They are wary of any large group, as the Elders still remember Voltanica. The village that the players see is just a small portion, where they are allowed. This is where the bartering happens.

Legislator’s Gavel
The legislators gavel. So the legislators gavel is an artifact currently in the possession of the Darkwaters. It belonged to their ancient ancestor, “The Legislator.”



The Darkwater Family
The Darkwaters are wealthy tiefling descendants of The Legislator, who had a hand in the creation of the law system long ago. One particular generation, labeled "the Insurgents," were siblings that shared ideals with their deity, Anarch, and brought corruption to the court of law. They were composed of 4 siblings: Ivan the Judge, Roman the Executioner, and the Darkwater Twins, Dante and Evie Darkwater, the King and Queen pins of their mafia known as "the Jury."
Ivan the Judge is the father to Ripley Darkwater and grandfather to Dickie Darkwater, who is unaware of all this corruption of law. Although the Insurgents lived long ago, their corruption still exists. Ripley continues to be a corrupt lawyer and members of "the Jury" still wander the streets, doing the bidding of anybody willing to pay, ie. the Darkwaters.
The Rot Wizard
A mysterious figure that lives in the forest close to Ranlean.
He seems to wear a leather suit that protects him from infectious diseases at all times.

No one knows who this person really is. Just that they keep a fair distance from everyone in his mushroom garden. Nice enough, this wizard. He (Or she?) waves at passersby and gives directions towards Ranlean.
