On Patrons
The usual story is that a warlock makes a promise with a demon, and this demon gives them a fraction of their power. In exchange for this power, the warlock is compelled to do the demon’s bidding. Often this demon is godlike, untouchable by the warlock.
But what if that’s not the case? What if the demon is made vulnerable, just as much as the warlock? As if the promise goes both ways?

Introducing the Lesser Demon’s Pact: The Magic of Knowing a Demon’s True Name.
Magic of True Name - A rare ability that can control the demons unleashed during ‘The Promise that Shattered the World”. When someone speaks the demon’s true name, their spells are counteracted. If a pact is made, then the player gains their abilities and spells, becoming a Warlock.

Magic casting is unique and fun. Make it as unique as possible.

How Magic Works
In Artheria, magic is still largely unknown, even by those who study it
There are various organizations studying it to this day. Libraries, Guilds, etc.
Some societies use it as a power source
It seems to be present in all things, living or nonliving
Sentient creatures can control it at will, specifically those that can communicate with spoken language.
Some non-sentient creatures can still use magic, although primitive methods.
The Sight, Shape, Sound, Noise and Feel of magic can vary incredibly. Spellcasting is personal.
If raw: Blue.
If from a God: White/Yellow.
If from a Demon: Red/Orange.
If from a Necromantic God: Purple/Black.
If from an older/nature/fey god: Green/Brown/Blue.
Various factors can change the appearance of Magic casting.
Source of Mana
Mentor
The Environment of the caster
Elves can uniquely taste magic. Most dare not to, since it can be like eating rotten flesh.
About a 1/10th of the world can cast magic. In Order:
Elves
Tieflings
Other Races
Humans
Halflings
Orcs
There seems to be a limit to how much magic a person can use in a set amount of time. Any more, and they experience Mana Burn.




Wizards use ingredients to cast magic
Some advanced wizards have a spellcasting focus where they can cast prepared ley lines that float in the air or ground. The leylines project from the spellcasting focus.
Certain Wizards will mark or tattoo alchemical symbols on their skin and hands to help with the spellcasting.

Clerics and Paladins usually have to speak and are bathed in a godlight when casting spells
Violent magic can alter the spellcaster’s eyes.
Druidic Magic is often very quiet. There is an element of visual trickery.
Demonic Magic is very unpredictable.
Tiefling Magic almost always darkens the environment and has a verbal component to it that lowers the caster’s voice to an unnatural degree.


Odd, Unusual Forms and Systems of Magic
Hard Magic - Lots of rules on how the magic comes to be. There is satisfaction once the spell has been cast.
Soft Magic -Magic happens without explanation or rules. Can be used as a justification of the impossible.


Abstract Concepts of Thought, in Real World Flesh Avatars. These avatars are slaves to the wizard, and try to break free. When the control is broken, the Binding cannot be done in the same fashion. The Concept remembers this binding and is summoned without limitation into the world. Often, the spellcaster is killed. The Avatar does not live long and is usually dispelled after some time. Seconds to days, not shorter than a few days.

Spells from plant seeds.

Magical Ability comes from a physical ailment. A person with scoliosis can turn to a snake. Often it is linked, but can take different forms.

A series of spells in the ringing of bells.

Shadow magic
The second type would be the spiritshadows, which are bound to each individual inhabitant of the Castle soon after their birth and again when they come of age. The shadowguards for children are able to alter their shape in various useful ways and serve to protect them until they come of age and bind their own personal spiritshadow. Big spoilers ahead for those who haven't read it. The spiritshadows are actually magical creatures from another world/dimension. The Castle inhabitants can use their light magic to send their spirits to this world, and while there they find a magical creature and use a mixture of light magic and the third magic to bind the creature to their shadow. The creature then returns to their world as their new spiritshadow, losing certain aspects and abilities but gaining others (like the ability to feed off light to grow stronger and regenerate). Many of the creatures have powerful abilities and magic themselves, and sometimes parts of that carry over into their shadow form. (For instance, since they were originally made of cloud creatures, Storm Sheperds can still alter their shape somewhat, unlike most adult spiritshadows, and use shadow lightning bolts.)

The idea of spirit shadows means there are soulbinders. People who go out looking to turn these sentient creatures into artifacts.

Simple Lineage Magic. Bakers, whose magic lies in their bodies. Their sweat and skin has magical properties that makes their bread delicious. Quite useless in most scenarios.

Magic from dietary consumption. Magic Eaters or something.

Magic from Powders thrown or applied.

Magic that only happens in the right environment. Such as a powerful lightning storm only on a cloudy day with someone who’s blood is of a powerful mage in the past.

Demon Friendship.

Magic from Language
