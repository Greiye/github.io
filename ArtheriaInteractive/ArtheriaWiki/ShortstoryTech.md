Short Story: (In bullet list)
The Modern Mage
“I read an old story. Short story. Maybe in the Base-Ed files somewhere? Forgot where I saw it.”
Cityscape
Rats, homeless, people fighting, gunshots. Pregnant woman shot in gut
Boy climbing on a wire. Parts fall off
Boy goes over the wire. Sticks some computer probe
Augmented 3d Visor over his eyes. Flashes of info
Command line view. Dictionary attack
Logged in. GUI loads.
He begins to download stuff
Wire collapses
He falls into the building underneath
Visor is busted. Uses an LED stick. Flickers.
“Stupid beam. Fall wrecked it a bit.”
Old Voice
“You must leave.”
Lights flicker. Nothing
“This is not your treasure to take”
Some lights flicker. A silhouette of a man.
Young boy
‘What is all this?”
‘Boy picks up a square
“It’s wet.”
Pages fall out of it
“Is… is this a book?”
“Pre-Net Tech. Hundreds of years ago. Worth hundreds for this one book alone. Let along shelves of em.”
Old Voice
“You know too much.”
-Chase scene
Augment Visor flashes
Old man sees
“This… where did you get this?”
Boy: It’s an old vid. Picked it up a long while back. Too many artifs. Corrupted. What do you know?
Old man: “... I know too much.”
Water begins to flood in
Old man begins to mumble
Kid is surprised
“...You’re… the guy in the vid. Not a VR Sim? THe real deal…”
Magic forces save the books from the water.

“Man is tired. Some of his fingers have blackened”

“This library… the world has changed. It opens to those, and only those… that believe.”
Old man: “My time draws near. These books are the work of thousands of Mages before me.
Not even magic is permanent. It ebbs and flows like any other science.”

Boy: “I’ll help you. I want to save this place.”

Old: You? A boy from now? Why?

Boy: Why does that matter? What choice do you have?
Old:...

Old man reaches for the boy’s hand, with paper in the gaps of his fingers.
Boy: “Hey, what are you-

Old: You believe! If you believe, then…
Think of your mother. Think of roots, plants wrapped around her, the smell of tree bark-

Boy: I’ve never seen a tree my whole life, I don’t

Old: Then veins! The blue blood of the earth rushing through the paper veins of the tree. Imagine the warmth, the microscopic cooking. Yes, I feel it… yes…

The paper slits shoot out. The old man grabs them all in a blink of an eye, and presents them to the boy.

Old:... Scorch marks.

Old Man takes his hand

…THis is it. The center of the Magus Arcanum.

A crystal. When it flickers for the last time, so too will the guardians holding the flood gates.

.Old:... I will train you, Boy. 

I will train you, until the last breath of the arcanum.
And when my time comes, so will yours.
You may very well be…
The Last Mage.
