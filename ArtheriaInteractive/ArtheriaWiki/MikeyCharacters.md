‘It’s important as a DM to have a character of every class to understand them, thus giving the players in their campaigns a time to shine and be the hero of the hour.’

The 3 Pillars of the game are Combat, Adventure, and Social Encounters. Thus every character roster should have:


A melee fighter for combat
A ranged fighter for ranged combat
A magic user to show how magic works
An adventurer that can solve puzzles and get to through dungeons
A talker for social encounters

Barbarian
Human
Haeki
Unplayed

Does not state it, but wants power. His own army.

Bard
Half-Elf
Natali Bourbon
A Mapmaker and Historian.
She wants to travel the world and create a guide.
She’s writing a book called “Tales of Artheria: A guide to our world.”
She understands that the world is constantly changing. Even so, she wants to visit every continent of the world, every capital, so that her book will one day sit in every bookshelf. Preferably coffeeshop libraries.


Cleric
Jaufran
Human Life Cleric.
Age 40’s.
Worships the God of Life. He is borderline suicidal, and wishes to die towards a greater goal for his god.
Every chance he gets he’ll try to convert believers. His Temple is actually quite fun, and they plan little outings for everyone. PG13. The Presbyter and his wife are responsible for this.
He has a close friend, a devout believer who organizes fun events for Adults, 18+. Nightclubs, Brothels, etc.

“My goddess, Lliira the Lovely. Joybringer. The risen corner of every mouth. She is summer’s warmth.
I follow in her teachings as a father to his daughter. I do what I must to keep others safe. This means erecting barriers and doing the unthinkable.

A father will do anything for his daughters. As do I.

I don’t wish for you to go to a shrine in her name, or to give alms. All I ask is that on a golden spring eve, when the weather permits, you choose to spend it making music with friends, baking bread with family, rather than toiling the fields on someone else’s lands. The used day will not miss you like the day you lived.

Lliira will see to your joy. She will stretch the sunlight just a little bit farther for you. Cut short the nights that you must be alone. 



(Joke Character)



Druid
Off-White (Mentioned in Jason’s Tiefling Two Shot)

A White Wolf
Used to lead a pack of Red Wolves. Has come in contact with the Straphan Forest Spirit, who sees that the forest can benefit from his becoming a human.

New to the world as a humanoid, he is often awkward, has trouble with people, and still does a lot of his animalistic habits such as sleeping on the floor. He forgets that he’s a human sometimes.

The Straphan Forest Spirit will not see him again, and will not take back his ‘blessing’ until he proves himself to the beings of the forest.

## Fighter
Veilo
Inspired by my first ever DnD Character, 3.5e
Ex-Soldier. Ratty Cloak. Special Helmet that is open at the face.

Veilo wants a world of peace. He works as a mercenary, but does his research to see if the mission can come to a clean end.

He’s conflicted about his participation in war. If you don’t join, innocents die. If you do, you feed into it. At the moment, he decides that this is better than ‘doing nothing and letting evil flourish’.

Veilo was the name of my great great grandfather. My mother told me that it meant the last one. What does this mean? I have no idea.

My immediate family would be me and my sister. My father was a good man.

My occupation is Soldier. Being a soldier has its ups and downs. When no one is looking, I try to affect as little lives as possible. This means capturing soldiers, keeping my soldiers under me away from civilians, and keeping the damage to a minimum.

I got along with my friends and family decently. I get along most with my Platoon. I got along the least with my above officers. I understand that they have to do certain things, practically war crimes, just following orders. For the benefit of the war front. I understand that too. But when you've seen the things that I have seen, and the devastation that your platoon allows, the unnecessary violence against women and children, for the sake of feeling in power, to pass the time, you would want to put a stop to that.

My important relationship would be with my sister. Our parents died in wartimes. We had to live off of the streets. Well I joined the war to earn a little bit of money for each of us. She managed to find a husband at a very young age, in the last moments that I had with her, I made a promise to protect her family for her. I'm not too close with her husband, but I do what I can for my nieces and nephews.

In the world, I live where the wars take me. In hotel rooms, it's intense.  I would say that I live with my brother-in-law, and my nieces and nephews. I live in a separate structure from them, practically an underground bunker.

My living environment is rural,  on the outskirts of town. Kind of like a Farmland.

I live very messy. One could say like a Spartan warrior, wherever whatever that means.  All of my weapons are maintained and cleaned close to my bed on a table. I start the day off with Turkish coffee. Coffee that is heated in  hot Sands. Occasionally I hunt. I enjoy the fruits and vegetables that my nieces and nephews grow.

My living space although very fundamental and basic, I do find myself decorating it with elements of Fire, and musical instruments. My sister enjoyed music.  For my little nieces and nephews I play the lute like instrument called an Oud.

I enjoy theater.

My least favorite food would be anything dry. My time as a soldier has taught me that dryer foods make you constipated. For this I enjoy soups.

On a daily basis I  wear something called a gutra.  Where I come from, there is plenty of sand and Sun.  The gutra  is a simple fabric that keeps both away from your face.  It can also be changed to whatever you need.

I also wear a very loose kind of cloak. A regular tunic, maybe baggy pants, and tie shoes.  Something that I can secure my feet too so I can run fast.

When I dress up, I like to dress in  various bright colors. Clean clothes. Something that reflects my culture.

My biggest pet peeve is when someone does not fully appreciate the weapons that they wield. That or any instruments, or things that they use on a daily basis. I myself enjoy ending the day by maintaining my weapons, even for a little while.

My biggest secret is that I enjoy feeling powerful. I enjoy dictating the future of someone's life. I felt this when I was with my squad.  Well occupying a city, we did what we liked with the men, the women, and the children. They were our playthings.

When it was time to leave, we simply left.  It was weird to think  that one's life was not in the hands of a god, of the  society that you live in. Your life is in the hands of a stranger who lives  a day or two away. They could have been your friend. Instead they slit your child's throat.

I enjoyed this. And I know that my friends do as well. We are monsters. And so monsters I slay.

My favorite childhood memory was when me and a bunch of the other orphans got together to share our food. This was  around the time that we lost our parents, me and my sister.  We had gotten used to the chance of soldiers. We had gotten used to the sound of horses.  For one moment, we felt like we had our community again.  After the war, our community had strengthened.  That moment was the start of recovery.

While stationed for a Siege, one of my buddies went AWOL. I had to find him as he had to take my shift. I found him with a young girl, tied at the hands. She was just a plaything.  It was in the  house, broken down by the war. Stone rubble and the smell of burnt wood.  There was fresh dry bread, on the Sands of the floor.  There was blood on my buddies hip.  He smiled at me, and said that after him it would be my turn.

I left. I didn't stop him.  I didn't know what to say.

When I saw him again, I didn't bring it up.  I pretended like it never happened.

As we left, I peeked over to the ruins where I saw the incident. Part of the house had collapsed over the spot where they were. Over the pile of wood, vultures.

I let that happen.

Organize some sort of organization that lessens the effect of War. War has been something I've known my whole life. One less soldier who puts his arms down means one less necessary death. It means one more father and a family. But I know that the nature of mankind and other sentience is to take and control.  I cannot stop an ocean, but I can redirect the river.   I know it's possible, even if I haven't seen it before.  I'll be the first.

My ideal life is being a part of a community.  A small one, something like 100 maybe 200 people. I want to manage the security of this place. I want to be the one to train the Young how to defend it from enemies and threats. I want to hide it away. You can't open a door  when you don't know where it is.

I want to spend my days in this community with people who are related to me.  I want to pass away at an old age and then my last moments be reminded of  my Redemption. I could have been like that Soldier in my squad. I don't know where he is now, but I wanted to arrive at the hereafter, for given by the lives that I were required to take and the suffering that I caused.

I know that I will cause much more suffering, I may have to take the lives of those who oppose me, but so long as I do one ounce more of good then bad, then it is not a bad life.

Character Development Tidbits
--------------------------------------------------
-Went to formal school, hence the accent.
-No serious romantic partners. I am 'saving himself' for my childhood love. But I am weak to beautiful humans/elves with forward personalities. I'll consider my first time to be a proper woman with developed rapport.
-I have a scar on my left knee from hunting in my childhood. It looks like a feather. I also have small scars underneath my right forearm and my right jawline from a fall.
-I enjoy climbing and was taught how to rappel down cliffs and walls.
-I fear cliffs. (Nasty fall that Sylphrena saw)
-I try to keep secrets to myself.
- I will only trust those who have proven themselves to me. Until then, I keep everyone at bay with average manners.
-I'm not too close with my family.
-I adore birds, but know that having pets is not within my destiny.
-I strongly dislike it when people flaunt their wealth.
-I come from a background of proving one's worth, and their attire should reflect that.
-I dislike it when people act rudely to anyone, and will look to disrupt the rude person indirectly. Like slipping a fish in their pocket or something.

My greatest fear is bringing shame to my family through ineptitude. Not being good enough. I will make them proud one day. But until then, I tell no one who I'm affiliated with.

The Glass is half full to me. I hope for the best but expect the worst.

In my comfort, I wear a simple green tunic and black pants/boots combination.


I laugh at most jokes but will try to stifle my laughs.


I show my affection by gifts and physical touch.


I want others to respect me and depend on me.


My weakest aspect is that I keep an emotional distance, in fear that others may use me somehow. Paranoia.


I'm very competitive when it comes to proving one's self, especially in more noble pursuits.


I live to bring honor to my family. Everyone will know who my family is and will have high expectations of them.


I don't like any leader that has not proven their mettle. I prefer a leader elected by the people.


I prefer to be indoors.


I am guilty of enjoying the company of women, sometimes ignoring my friends just to have a proper conversation with a beautiful woman.


I stand for being a contributing member of one's community, not necessarily society. To inspire another generation of leaders.


I rely on my good manners to de-escalate most problems.


If I could, I'd change my passivity. I want to be more assertive and be more savage-like when going for what I want. But that's not within my nature. I'm more diplomatic than that.


I am obsessed with my family, and making them well known throughout the realm.


My greatest regret is losing contact with my childhood friend.


I value trust in my friends. Their trust that I am capable in solving whatever life throws at me.


My signet ring bears the mark of a quill with elven-inspired decorum.

Chapter 3: Survivors
26APRIL2022




Session 1
Upon return home for Divide Day, hoping to see any of his family, Candor sees that his home has been burned to the ground.

He leaves Tangen, his hometown, and goes to Gestal, the capitol. There, he meets a group of people who seek to have an audience with the king.

Jeilani - Homeless Halfling Spellcaster
Tacita - Elvish Woman
Manbun 'Cid' - Human Rogue

And from a description by Jeilani, He may know of Hiss, a nephew of the Barman in the Gestallion Inn.

Upon hearing about the burning of Tangen from Jeilani, Candor states that he can help them, and joins them. They toast to friendship, and Jeilani asks where Candor is from . He lies, stating he's from Daryl.

Seeing the rivalry between Candor and Cid, Jeilani asks them to play hide and seek. They discover both rogues promptly.

He reveals to Jeilani that he does not actually come Daryl, but rather Tangen, where his home has burnt down.

After meeting up with the rest of the group and being caught unaware by Jeilani's ability to telepath to him, Candor goes along with Jeilani's joke and begins to speak Draconic to his as he speaks Abyssal, choosing this language rather than Thieves Cant, as Manbun may understand him. Tacita sees through this and responds in Draconic, embarrassing Candor.

They retire for the night on beef stew. Soon, they will attend a jousting tournament where in the king will have an audience with the winners.

Personality
-His time as a 3rd abandoned child from Nobility gave him an idea of how nobles operate. He understood things like pedigree, and power dynamics at a young age. He doesn’t really associate with his family history too much. They left him, after all. It sometimes feels like a dream he made up, from age 10 to 20.
