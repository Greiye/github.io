The Scale of Amethyst Peak
The Founding
Anarch was a deity of Lachesism; a belief that one can be made better through a disaster that borders on traumatic. Thousands of years ago, during the Era of Ice, Anarch had traveled the continent of Caerne. On the Western part, along the mountain ranges, he hiked to the tallest mountain he could see, along with those who followed him. There, he drew inspiration from the tallest volcano nearby. It bled molten rock, red with the power to devastate anything in its flow. Anarch could not help but watch it.

Flying Beasts of Magic
As he watched the magnificence of it, he was witness to giant reptiles that flew overhead. This is the first sighting of Dragons. These enormous beasts could only fly through magical means. Anarch was sure of it. He felt it.

He watched the dragons as they gave tributes to the largest of their kind, a small group no more than two or five. He observed intelligence in these beasts. He named the larger dragons The Elder Dragons of Arcavios.

Anarch wanted their power for himself. They were like the living forms of the lava he had watched. They were powerful, unrelenting, ruling above their own kind. He wanted to tame them.

After taming these dragons, he used them as beasts of burden along with his followers to build the settlement now known as Amethyst Peak, right above the mountain that he studied. 

A thousand years passed. If there were any wild dragons left to take, Anarch did not know of them. The Elder Dragons had long since left. destroyed or having migrated elsewhere.

Dragonglass

There is a settlement not far from Amethyst Peak named Dragonglass. It was called “The Town with Dragonglass” initially until people found it easier to just call it by the name of its chief export.

The crystal known as dragonglass is an interesting material ,used to create magical swords for the Jagged Edge Knights. It is just as durable as any metal, with no mention of the weapon ever shattering. When these knight grabbed onto this colorless glass weapon its magic would interact with their baseline emotion which gave it color.

Dragonglass Swords vary in color and take on many different properties. They can be of different size and weight, length and decor. To save material, the blade’s handle, hilt and pommel are usually made of obsidian or another type of metal and not the dragonglass itself. Although some Jagged Edge Knights request for the entire weapon to be one unbroken piece of Dragonglass. The blade can be translucent with a dim, consistent glow to it. Some knights have swords that have a constant bright glow to it that can be just as bright as a lantern.
Dragonglass also emerges from the hilt in various methods. Some blades may extend like a crystal suddenly growing, or shoot out in a beam of light.

Dragonglass Smithing is very time consuming compared to the time needed to create a traditional iron sword. To craft a single blade takes about a week.

 It requires the knowledge of a skilled glass artisan, a weapon smith, and 2 dragons. Many glass artisans and weaponsmiths can guess as to how the dragon glass is formed. Glass smiths speculate that it needs to be melted down, as with regular glass. But Dragonglass has been documented to retain its form even when doused in lava. And how would one sand the glass down to a razor sharp edge? Sanding down glass requires the use of a material harder than the object itself. If an object did exist, it would be used as a counter weapon to break dragon glass swords.

The exact method of its creation is a well guarded secret, known only by the few smithing families that create it. Hence, why most dragonglass smiths live along the nobles of Amethyst Peak. The material is hard to work with. But once it’s been crafted into a usual product, it fetches for an incredible price.

Dragon glass is used in all of the windows of Castle Blackthorne, providing it with a decoration that also doubles as a layer of defense against attacks. Only Castle Blackthorn could afford to install stained glassworks within the structure. Nobles that live around Castle Blackthorne are said to be able to afford only one dragonglass pane per generation. These panes are used to display the wealth of one’s family.




The Failed Conquests
Countless battles had been fought for the power that Anarch himself earned. With flying beasts that could breathe fire, every battle was won in his favor. Soon, Amethyst Peak became home to the greatest fighters and dragon riders. One notable battle was that between Amethyst Peak and Black Bay. They had failed. Since then, his settlement had become a symbol of strength and power to all other settlements. The castle walls not even once, touched by invader hands.

Then during the war, before he was king, he knew that he didn’t have the fighting skills to help win the war. But he was confident in his ability to see the best in people. So he created a team of who he personally thought would be a great aid to the fight and he equipped each of them with a unique dragon glass weapon

The Current Monarchy
The kingdom's current ruler is Teofilo Blackthorn, known by various nicknames such as "The Bardic King" and "The Lute of Embers." However, his personal favorite is "Filo the Amereoux," bestowed upon him due to his reputation for engaging in playboy antics. His charismatic nature not only facilitated his romantic conquests, but it also played a pivotal role in rallying his army. King Filo's mastery of the rapier made him a formidable swordsman, yet his true gift lay in the art of Sword Dancing, which he used to inspire others. This exceptional talent, combined with his innate leadership abilities, led to his ascent as the king. Throughout his adventurous endeavors, he amassed a considerable number of lovers, demonstrating his broad-mindedness in his choices.

The Firstborn: Son of the Dragon Mother.
The mother of his first child bore an extraordinary secret. Saphira Maleys, a dragon who had been magically transformed into a human, became entwined in his life, leading to the birth of their son, Lance. Being the offspring of a unique union, Lance possessed the blood of both human and dragon, making him a formidable half-dragon. As he matured, his exceptional combat skills earned him the revered title of the Dragoon Knight of Amethyst Peak. Unbeknownst to many, Lance bore the rightful claim to the throne, yet he carried himself without airs of entitlement. Along his path as a warrior, he encountered Valka Tessarion, a skilled dragon rider, and their union gave rise to a daughter named Lancia, who would inherit the legacy of her remarkable lineage.

Flame Incarnates
Belial, the son of Alpas Urere, was born of an extraordinary lineage. His mother, an embodiment of the fiery essence known as a flame elemental, bestowed upon him the heritage of a flame genasi. In a fateful union, Belial married Eros Nefeli, an earth genasi, leading to the birth of their child, Biliran, who became a unique combination known as a lava para-genasi. Both Belial and Biliran shared a reputation as merciless combatants, aligning themselves with the ideology of Anarch. Unconcerned with the consequences of their destructive and chaotic fighting style, they displayed little regard for the collateral damage left in their wake. Belial, hailed as the Hellflame, and Biliran, known as the Scorched-Earth Soldier, became infamous figures, embodying their respective monikers.

No Need for a Queen
Within the kingdom, the court harbored deep-rooted prejudice, vehemently opposing the prospect of Lance ascending the throne and thereby paving the way for a future Queen in the form of Lancia, his rightful heir. Instead, their preference leaned toward King Filo's second son, Belial, for he already had a son of his own, Biliran. In their eyes, this ensured the continuation of the kingdom's traditional patriarchal rule.

In a sinister bid to thwart the possibility of a Queen's reign, the court devised a treacherous conspiracy aimed at eliminating Lance and his family. This calculated act would secure Belial's position as king, allowing the court to maintain their grip on power. However, Lance, ever watchful, caught wind of their nefarious plot. Recognizing the danger that loomed over his loved ones, he took the decisive step of sending Lancia to Strixhaven—a place where she could not only discover the truth of her birthright but also receive training to prepare herself for the eventual battle for the throne against her cousin, Biliran.

During her journey to the esteemed institution, Lancia, the true heir to the throne, received the shattering news of her parents' untimely demise. In a realm of uncertainty and intrigue, she realized that she had now become the Daughter of the Uncrowned King, burdened with the responsibility of reclaiming her rightful place in the kingdom's tumultuous struggle for power.

Word has traveled that Biliran has left the kingdom. This has inspired fear in the hearts of Amethyst Peaks’ enemies. Specifically Black Bay. People fear that a war may break out, due to Biliran’s reputation as a soldier.
