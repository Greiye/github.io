nD Session 15
Yoshua and Saint find themselves in a desert town. They recently just got back together and are doing a small tour as a mercenary pair as celebration for meeting back up. Yoshua was recently abandoned by his tribe. Saint has some magical ability, but is not yet fully realized.

They ride a wagon to what they thought would be their hometown. Regnor Perdu. An academia town.

To the Sands of Sornes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1 for Yoshua and Saint: What did you immediately go to?
Q2 Ramssess

Q3 Nezra
You've been promoted to agent, tasked to ascertain if an Outreach Outpost is suitable. An outpost being a small shack that supports 3 agents to help develop the town, spread the word about the organization, then reassigning agents. They want to know how long they should have an outpost in Sornes for, before the township and the organization can make a fair agreement for resources.

They wake up after a bar brawl, incited by Yoshua. They are bruised and battered.

A figure steps over them.

Nezra.
It's been months since Nezra had seen Yoshua. With Nezra, Ramssess. Who had informed Nezra that he is on a quest to return to his group, a clan of elven desert striders.

Nezra has been assigned to be a sole agent for the Former Cobalt Soul. (A name change is in the works.) She just so happened to come upon Ramssess as he looked lost in the town square (as lost as she did). She was tasked to do recon, see if there is any value for Former Cobalt Soul Outreach Program to set up base here. She's been due to return 2 weeks ago.

They meet up and talk at a safer place. (Bar)


Quest:
Yoshua Saint: Get back to Regnor Perdu. or find money to get a ride to Regnor.
Nezra: Help Ramssess find his group
Ramssess: Find his group

The town doesn't get too many travelers, or wagons. The next one is due a month from now.

The ones who fought Yoshua and Saint are the nicer orc raiders. (If they remember this)

A cloaked figure (Leopold the Farmer) comes up to the group. It looks to be a halfling. He asks the group to clear out whatever's been killing his buffalo. (It's a giant were-falcon)


Leopold is a Orc, who is incredibly handsome. He used to live with the raiders but was constantly harassed for his looks.

In return, the farmer will take them to where they need to go, and half of all the gold he has.

1: Find Clues
Barn, Plains, Buffalo Remains

2: Dinner with the Farmer
He's curious about his hires. Curious about the Elven Striders, the Cobalt Soul, and Yoshua and Saint's relationship.
3: Attack during dinner (Pitch Black)
3: Investigate (Cave or Oasis, as mentioned by the Farmer)
Cave has glowing stactites, and a pool of water that grants 1+ Strength. Oasis has rare materials that are worth a good amount of silver.
4: Discovery
The second place will have the source, a giant pile of feathers. Inside a toddler giant sleeping.

How to handle this?

Upon return, the farmer is working hard, his bandages soaked in sweat.

Hearing the news, he pulls open a closet, and reveals a wall with countless tusked skeletons. He fishes out some gold and gives them to the party.

Riding the wagon, the group have a moment to talk to each other.
