### The First World
Before the modern times, our ancestors came from a far away land. This place is known as the First World.

### Roaming Spirits
Before the world is at it was, it was a place of spirits. Godchildren, the living god of the collossus, what ever they were, they roamed the planet as shapeless beings, absorbing each other.

##### A Rogue's Thoughts on Spirits
"Spirits? Why would you want to know how I feel about all that? Listen; I'm along for the ride right until you need something killed. Then it's  2 gold per head. That's it.


I mean,

We had to come from something. We didn't just appear on the planet. So I suppose I believe in it. So, if that whole godblood thing is true, then spirits of all shapes and sizes ran right out those titan veins."

#### Changelings of the World
The first sentient beings, the proto-man. They resemble the spirits that they call their ancestors, slightly glowing in light. They could change their shape, but not their size; unlike their spirit ancestors.


## Beastmen
Rather than constantly change what they were, some changelings permanently took the form of the animals that we see today. The Beastmen are the linked between the changelings and the flora and fauna. Most Beastmen pray to the Rabbit God, a spirit that is responsible for the then high population of the Beastmen. They also worship their totem animal. 

### Followers of the Rabbit God
The Rabbit God is known to be the last remaining spirit of the First World.


### Giants: The Children of Titans
The Giants believe that their ancestors were not spirits or changelings, but rather the last surviving titan couple. They have 6 fingers and round ears, unlike the elves. Because of their culture and location, Giants stayed in their Stone age, working together to bring down massive beasts bigger than them.

#### Servants to the Land
After the creation of humans, the elves have become mostly seclusive to their own. They live in villages and towns that are secluded, difficult to reach and are often protected by means of magic.
Of all the races they are the ones that are most unforgiving. They attack beastmen on sight and see humans as ‘inbred elves’. They are hostile towards orcs due to their learned history of raiding and war. While they find Tieflings unsightly, they do enjoy talking about magic with them. 

They enjoy halflings, taking kinship in their long lifespan of about 400 years. Most agree that they are undisciplined, compared to the common elf.

The Elven Capital is where the elves believe the Travelers first landed on Atheria. The heart of the city is an academy. In this academy, there is a structure made of metal and rust, believed to house all of the knowledge of the Fairies and the Elven Ancestors. This structure is guarded by a small army of metal golems, guided by the wielder of a circlet. The circlet is worn by the Elven King.

The structure is off limits to the local populace, guarded by the Royal Army. Any attempt to break past the gates is met with death. 

There have been attempts to study the structure; all met with destruction by the hands of the golem guards. It seems only the wielder of a circlet can bypass the guards. In Elven history, a queen was brave enough to enter the structure with a 2nd circlet, the queen’s circlet, never to return. Some elven archeologists say that most likely part of the structure collapsed, killing the brave queen. With no one else able to enter except for the king, she was doomed. It would have been foolish for the leader of the elven society to go after her, leaving the throne open. There was also the chance of the last circlet disappearing with the king, leaving the structure’s only key into the structure gone forever.

In elven history, the travelers were mostly elves and fairies working together. Archeologists say that a fairy may be the key to entering the structure without the need of a circlet. But with the extinction of fairies, that method too, is no longer possible.


Elves look down on other elves that regularly interact with other races, as they see that their society is everything an elf could ask for. “City elves must enjoy living in the slums that only a mixed society can afford.”

To keep updated in continent news, Elves will travel to other elf-populated towns to converse and keep each other safe. This creates an odd gray area for elves that live in the city, because how else would their ‘more pure’ cohorts learn of continent affairs if not for them? Elves commonly have identity issues that deal with tradition versus modernity.

Depending on where they live, elves have been noted to absorb the elements around them, their magic casting adopting the texture and color of where they’ve been raised. The Elves that spent their childhood in the desert have a sandy feel to them; their forest relatives, casting with the appearance of leaves and twigs.

Elves are practically humans, but their relationship with mana makes them live longer. Their bodies more elongated, their longevity up to thousands of years. They physically do not age, but instead their mana ages over time. Other mana users can sense this. Mana users remark that older elves, if not taken care of, feels greasy, and smells like older humans.

Elves usually live 1000 years. By their 900th year, their magic begins to fade. By 950, they can no longer cast magic. They begin to lose perception of time. They begin to fade, appearing like a ghost with a glowing center. They meditate for one last time. When this happens, they fade away, becoming part of their biome. Wood elves turn into wood, Tundra elves become ice.

### Divergent Lineages

{{wide
##### Elf Types
| Elf | Location and Description |
|:-----------|:-------------:|
| Wooden Elves     | Main Lineage during the purge. They make great acrobats swing from tree vines.
| Darker Elves     | Elves that live in the underdark with Tieflings. They are sensitive to light, but can see the dark better than their other elven counterparts.
| City Elves       | Elves returning to human society. They have much more mana and intellect than other elves.
|Tundran Elves     | Elves that live in Tundra Pockets. They are much more paler, more fair than the other elves. They are dependent on technology more.
|Sorne Elves       | Live in the Sornes Desert. They usually wear loose, white clothing.
|Water Elves       | Live Close to Water. Often they are in the waters in wetsuits or simply naked. Because of their proximity to water, they find clothing annoying as they have to put it on and off. A such, the vast majority of men and women simply wear black shorts.

Elves believe that their ancestors were spirits that prospered in peaceful times. As such, they did not need to constantly change, and were fine with the form that they are now. This is why they can use magic, the ability of the spirits. They lead long lives, up to 1000 years.


#### Fairies of another Realm
So different from the Beastmen, the giants, Fairies are small sentient beings that resemble elves, save for their four wings and their intelligence to use the magic around them rather than within them. Fairies that use the magic within them have shorter lifespans than those that use the magic within the flora and fauna. Due to their size, they were often preyed upon by common animals. Elves used to associate fairies with the realm of spirits, thinking such small creatures can only exist in a place outside of reality.
The fairies had a symbiotic relationship with the Elves, at first indirectly. In both their histories, there is legend of the first friendship between them, which gave birth to magic that could heal.


#### The First War
The Giants were constantly at war with the beastmen for territory and food source. It was the beastmen first that contacted the elves, enslaving them in hopes of using their magical abilities. Resilient elves were used as living shields in beastmen's war against the giants. It is said that the elves betrayed the fairies. Tribes of beastmen would drink elven blood in hopes of gaining their strength. Through the elves, beast men made use of the fairies. Much like the way the fairies used the world’s mana, the beastmen grinded fairies up for their potions and combat magic.

The war transpired for many generations. This dwindled the population of all races, especially the elves and the fairies.
