Yellow Blood: Necromancy

Edited Dec 17 2022
(Beihorn Duskrest, elf who dabbled in dark revival magic)
This story focuses on dark magic more.

Idea
An infection that was encased in ice, now exposed to the world.
Magic that destroys red blood cells. 
-Story has to be magic related, the science part is already covered

The journal details the study of necromancy. Written by a necromancer, it details his process. How they would kill small animals and practice bringing them back to life. The author tested just how far they could go. How damaged the creature could be before the spell failed.

“...The squirrels with the slit throats would bleed out of their necks like waterfalls. It would all gush out fairly quickly. Cleaning up was a mess. The 2nd trial fared better. With the slit throat sewed up, they lasted a whole 10 seconds longer before slumping down motionless. The ones I crushed with a rock would only twitch their legs back to life. Specimens should be healed before they’re resurrected. Will this scale to humanoids?”
…………………...

The following chapters detail how they continued to practice as they got older, keeping it a secret from their friends and family. 

“It was something like a game, hearing the rumors about how graverobbers had dug up the cemetery for the 3rd time this year. If they ever caught me, I’d be hanged.


The bodies I recovered are doing well. They’re moving around, but decomposition continues. One of them fell over my soup. They’re aimless. No kind of head activity. Can I make them do chores?

Hasn’t been dead in quite some time. Some bodies were unusable.

Should I dig up my mother?”
………………………..

It then details their blunders.

“Entry 26 (the words are messily scrawled). One of them bit me. Fine tuned my spell to make them smarter. Guess that part of the brain for hunger was revived. Bit off 3 of my left hand fingers.”

The book ends there.
…………………...

At the end of the back cover, a Minute Lesser Animate Dead Spell Scroll (practically a scrap of paper.) Can reanimate the dead for 20 seconds. Can be used by Clerics Druids or Wizards. (Mention this to the DM to get the Scroll) Obtained by St. Gabriel.



Scales of the Shore: A Blue Water Dragon Informational
It’s a small picture book of Blue Water Dragons.

Deep in the oceans of the world lies the Blue Water Dragon, a fearsome creature that has been responsible for the deaths of many merchant ships due to careless route planning. They are incredibly aggressive and will attack any creature that they see on sight. They live along the sea shores, but some have been known to live as far as 30 miles inland.

Not to be confused with Sea Dragons, as Blue Water Dragons have wings.

Blue Dragons are immune to poison and cannot be exhausted, paralyzed or restrained through magical means. They seem to be able to sense things without their vision, as far as 60 feet away. Any magical flame can be quenched by them that we know of.

They have been known to breathe a salt spray that freezes anything immediately. Alternatively, they can also emit a steam spray, scalding anything as far as 60ft. Can create, destroy or control water at will.

Friar Birel Lialdon: Life of a Elven Follower
This book details one follower of the Church of the First. The autobiography is a pilgrimage that goes West following the trail of the Demigod Ein. He follows the place where Ein lit the signal fires that kept the west cities safe from the savage attacks. Past the South waters where he fought off his fallen brothers and sister. Birel Lialdon continued his pilgrimage until the city of Lyalondeshe where he grew tired of travel.

Some say he was visited by the demigod Ein himself. Given a part of his blue flame, his soul. The flame was placed in a giant brazier in the center of the Basilica that Birel started. This flame is said to survive any strong wind. No matter how small the giant flame shrivels to, the core flame stays constant.



Eastern Affairs: War of the East (or lack thereof)
The Tiefling/Orc War
The Kingdom of Lostia has had centuries of war campaigns. At some point they were at war with every society around them. Despite their ferocity and incredibly enduring metal war machines, Lostia has neither won nor lost any war they’ve been involved in due to far too much infighting. Their deserts are filled with abandoned machinery.

As small incursion groups, Lostia Orcs have been incredibly efficient. Their raiding parties are to be feared, as they employ any technologies and weapons available to them.

So long as you stick to the coast, you should be fine.Orcs are very careful not to engage with the water serpents that plague their coasts.

Farm Beasts: The Goblin Plague
The book details Goblins and their pestilence. Goblins are remnants of the Biomancer of Nier, who had genetically manipulated the races around the kingdom to forge his own race. Goblins were his strain of soldiers meant to tire the opposition out through sheer number. As a byproduct, the Goblins multiply quickly, reaching adulthood in a mere 5 years.

Having an average span of 25 years, goblins are short lived. Whatever knowledge they gain is not passed down as well as other goblinoid cultures. These creatures are not strong, nor enduring or intelligent. But they are nimble and creative with what they use as weapons.

They were genetically designed to be able to impregnate any female from any humanoid race and several species of pig, as their genetic makeup is constantly breaking down with each generation.

Ethical Biomancers estimate for Goblins to go extinct within 8 generations (200 years).

Elven Gods
One way or another, the group has learned that elves worship a small pantheon of gods. One of them seems to be a trickster.

Hollows
People whose souls are taken. Empty Vessel. Related to Dr Podrigo, Dhampicillin, a plant that creates mana. (Look at Headcrabs from Half-Life for reference of where the disease comes from. Patient Zero)

Church of the First
Long ago, there was a pantheon of gods, each taking the form of white-winged spirits, bathing in golden flames and protected by swirling rings of gold and marble. At first, these gods created and cared for the few sentients of the world. As the world grew so did the god’s contempt for their creations. Being immortal meant seeing their children make the same mistakes again, never learning. Over time, they grew tired of leading their flock. They became enticed by their children’s discoveries and transmutation of the world. They would travel down in pairs, assuming the form of their creation and manipulating the mortals. Soon, they played with them like toys, living vicariously through them. For they could not do what they did without permanently sacrificing their form. No one god had kept their mortal form for longer than a day. One of the gods was known as Ein. He stood, declaring this practice wrong. To this, the other gods attacked Ein, forcing Ein with them to the mortal realm. There, one amongst many, the gods permanently took his rings of protection. They summoned several calamities then returned to their God-Home without him, saying they would change their ways if he could find his way back home, alone. A feat no single god had done. Without his rings, Ein could be hurt. He needed the light of the Gods Bath, to retain his godly powers. He was doomed to become mortal and perish. With the help of new friends and a demon turned ally, Ein traveled the world. Together they survived storms and cold snaps; heat waves and wars. Countless disasters, all to reach the tallest peak in the land. From there, he revealed his 6 winged form and attempted to fly home, without a god as a partner.

Ein flew for years nonstop to reach the Gods-home. Along the way, his wings began to molt and fall from the stress. The bitter gods send opposition. Ein uses the last of his golden flame to escape them. When he reached the gates, Ein’s wings had been broken beyond repair, only one left wing hanging on a thread and the remaining right one barely functional. Seeing their brother return, the gods kept their word. They vowed to stop their ways. But after a few centuries, they regressed back. Who could stop them? Ein had decided to return, for he found those below more godlike in nature. Before leaving, Ein destroys the Gods Bath and poisons the clouds with an ever growing bed of thorns. Once below, Ein hides his rings and stows away the rest of his flame in a brazier. Once again adopting his mortal form, he returns to his friends. With his golden flame gone, Ein was mortal. After his passing, his friends and family erected a shrine in his name; With the Gods Bath broken, the remaining gods could not stop the overgrowth. One by one, they fell to the mortal world. Not the first god to come below, Ein was the first to stay permanently. “It is not where we’re from or where we’re going, but how we get there, and the help we get along the way.” Be the First. For you may not be the last.”

House of Basalt
Harut and Marut are two twin gods who were trapped in the mortal realm in their female form. The betrayer Eyan had forsaken his older brothers and sisters, who regularly bathed in the waters of the Sudatory to retain their godly powers. Harut, Marut and their siblings would regularly visit their mortal creations and do what they can to help out in little ways.

Eyan grew tired of a god's life. Acting on impulse, Eyan traveled by himself to the mortal world rather than waiting for a partner. There he found that he was stranded. The siblings thought this a chance to learn a lesson, leaving him to come home. He would have to fly to the highest peak on the opposite side of the world. Upon reaching the peak, they would travel and pick him up.

All was well, but little did they know, Eyan had developed a grudge. Having consorted with a devil, Eyan had brought home a vial of Frostfire; a mythical flame that freezes all it touches . After putting broken glass in the Sudatory, the frostfire spread quickly. Soon the gods fell to the mortal world.

Harut and Marut survived.After some time, Eyan found them. Eyan found all his siblings dead, save for these two. He was interested in restarting their godly bloodline, and forced himself upon his two sisters. He had his golden flame tucked away. 

After Eyan left to gather home supplies, the sisters fled. They etched a home in a face of basalt columns, trusting no one. Soon they gave birth to their children, a boy and two girls. They cast the boy out, giving him to a lone mother.

The world is a terrible place, and those who betray you are not to be trusted. Often you will have to craft your own safety.
