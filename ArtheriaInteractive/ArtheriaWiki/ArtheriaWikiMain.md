Black Bay
Kingdom that sees Amethyst Peak as Rival, They besieged Anarch and Amethyst Peak before. “We’ll take land and sea”. Black Bay has previously tried to domesticate ‘Aquateras’, a beast equal to a timid dragon. This was when a heroic group called the Crucibles came in to stop them. (Forest Power Rangers)

Ranlean
The Town of Arcanic Development
The progressive technological marvel of Artheria. It boasts to be the cutting edge of the world’s technology. The first settlement to have an official social-republic government.

Citizens have access to the largest library in all of the Caerne continent. In the center of the library, there is a Planetarium. Protected by Ranlean’s Police Department (RPD). Has a hospital, and banking system. The streets are kept lit with lightbulbs, thanks to the mercury stores. They chiefly export technology and innovative products.
Has a lot of Strixhaven Graduates. Has some corruption with the Darkwaters.

One of their rarer fruits that grow only in Ranlean is Ranlean Rhambutan, a blue fruit with long hairlike growth. 

They pay homage to Vellichor, known by some as the great sage. 
The Town prizes education above all else.


Ranlean’s Goal
Information is your greatest tool. The mind is a blade that is always concealed. It is the hammer and nails that stay in your hand.

Aralon
A small farming Town, Aralon is known to be the hub of creatives and artists, often in the Hanging Gardens. Thanks to the numerous salt flats close to the town, Aralon can provide everyone with quality food products to all neighboring settlements. Citizens are always wearing raincoats and hats in the event of sudden rain.

On the outskirts of town is a farmer’s market, where you can meet Granny Smith and her pets, Magic Greer and all his magical wares. Be sure to visit Father Padre who runs a Chapel of the First.

Petrichor is a popular god of Agriculture in this part of the Hymlie Principality.

Aralon’s Goal:
A Peaceful life is its own reward. Everyone has a right to it. Acknowledge it, cherish it, for when it is gone in the storm of life, it is all that you wish you had.











Caspa


Also known as;
The Float, The Floating City of Feathers, The Feathered City, Owlin Territory, The Beak


Virasana
A settlement that chooses to live in harmony with nature.
People often have no sense of ownership here, aside from nature’s ownership.
There is a notable lack of boundaries and physical structures such as gates, fences, and the like. Most Virasanans gather their goods from symbiotic relationships with the plants and animals around them.

Most people live with each other, occasionally staying at each other’s ‘homes’.


Alloyed Forces


Sornes
(Emgou Lore)

A desert village. Has a sizable half-orc population. (Raq, Yoshua)
Sornes is occasionally attacked by orcs and goblins. The goblins are failed orc reproduction.

It’s a dangerous little village that serves as a waypoint to other places.

A Sheriff lives here and tries to keep the peace. Most people rely on the sheriff for safety.

Elves
Elves come from a primitive homeworld. Due to their long lives of 1000 years, they have witnessed many events. One event being the creation of humans. Their literature is considered to be of high quality to scholars and archeologists as their cultural pride made their content highly researched and valued to be as accurate as possible.

After the creation of humans, the elves have become mostly seclusive to their own. This was due to fear of the unknown, as well as humans having an appearance weirdly uncanny to elves, except for the ears and height. 

Elves live in secluded villages and towns that are difficult to reach due to predators in their past. These settlements are often protected by means of magic as a secondary line of defense.

Of all the races, elves are considered the most unforgiving, holding grudges for centuries.They attack beastmen on sight and see humans as ‘inbred elves’. They are hostile towards orcs due to their learned history of raiding and war. While they find Tieflings unsightly, they do enjoy long conversations with them about magic. 

They enjoy halflings, taking kinship in their long lifespan of about 400 years. Most agree that they are undisciplined, compared to the common elf.

The Elven Capital is where the elves believe the Travelers first landed on Atheria. The heart of the city is an academy. In this academy, there is a structure made of metal and rust, believed to house all of the knowledge of the Fairies and the Elven Ancestors. This structure is guarded by a small army of metal golems, guided by the wielder of a circlet. The circlet is worn by the Elven King.

The structure is off limits to the local populace, guarded by the Royal Army. Any attempt to break past the gates is met with death. 

There have been attempts to study the structure; all met with destruction by the hands of the golem guards. It seems only the wielder of a circlet can bypass the guards. In Elven history, a queen was brave enough to enter the structure with a 2nd circlet, the queen’s circlet, never to return. Some elven archeologists say that most likely part of the structure collapsed, killing the brave queen. With no one else able to enter except for the king, she was doomed. It would have been foolish for the leader of the elven society to go after her, leaving the throne open. There was also the chance of the last circlet disappearing with the king, leaving the structure’s only key into the structure gone forever.

In elven history, the travelers were mostly elves and fairies working together. Archeologists say that a fairy may be the key to entering the structure without the need of a circlet. But with the extinction of fairies, that method too, is no longer possible.

Elves look down on other elves that regularly interact with other races, as they see that their society is everything an elf could ask for. “City elves must enjoy living in the slums that only a mixed society can afford.”

To keep updated in continent news, Elves will travel to other elf-populated towns to converse and keep each other safe. This creates an odd gray area for elves that live in the city, because how else would their ‘more pure’ cohorts learn of continent affairs if not for them? Elves commonly have identity issues that deal with tradition versus modernity.

Depending on where they live, elves have been noted to absorb the elements around them, their magic casting adopting the texture and color of where they’ve been raised. The Elves that spent their childhood in the desert have a sandy feel to them; their forest relatives, casting with the appearance of leaves and twigs.

Elves are practically humans, but their relationship with mana makes them live longer. Their bodies are more elongated, their longevity up to thousands of years. They physically do not age, but instead their mana ages over time. Other mana users can sense this. Mana users remark that older elves, if not taken care of, feel greasy, and smell like older humans.

Elves usually live 1000 years. By their 900th year, their magic begins to fade. By 950, they can no longer cast magic. They begin to lose perception of time. They begin to fade, appearing like a ghost with a glowing center. They meditate for one last time. When this happens, they fade away, becoming part of their biome. Wood elves turn into wood, Tundra elves become ice. After death, a ritual is held. In this ritual, friends and family of the deceased are taken to the wildlands closest to where they died. The remains of the deceased are mixed back into the world. A bonfire is started, and the personal belongings of the deceased are burned. Whatever is left in the bonfire’s ashes is melted down or given to the next of kin. The melting down is seen as another act of becoming one with the land once again.

Beastmen
After the war along the giants in ancient history, Beastmen were hunted due to their former alliance with the giants. They took shelter in the wilds where no other race could survive. They fought with one another for leadership, but that endeavor has since dissolved as they adapted to their new surroundings.

Now the beastmen have found purpose in taming animals and becoming close to animals that closely resemble them as well as other beasts. It is common for those from the feather clan to have a roost of eagles and falcons, and so on.

Every 4 years, beastmen from around the continent will travel to a competition sponsored by a beastman settlement to see who can win the beastman artifact for their tribe. The Artifact is a kind of cloak that signifies the clan that is most ready for war. The competition became a regular event to control the beastmen’s hunger for war, without reducing their already dwindling population.


The occasional beastman can be found in mixed society, but only if they are traveling with their ‘herd’ or ‘flock’. They are more trusted than orcs, but not by much. Still, if in need for a finely tamed creature, a beastman’s bond has no competition in quality.

Beastmen come in all shapes and sizes, living in tribes where the majority is one specific subculture of beast. The beast they have similarities to is the creature they worship. Their method of worship varies greatly between tribes. Some capture and release their totem as a rite of passage, some eat their totem. Often their totem is nearby or tamed into servitude, depending on the animal’s nature and chance of predating the tribe.

Beastmen who try to procreate with another beast culture are met with disappointment. Their genes are not fit. Often these offspring are cast out. Some speculate that this practice is why there are so many odd creatures in the wilds.

Halflings
For a time, halflings were resentful of their captors, the beastmen and the elves. But that dissent disappeared with time. As they live long lives compared to most other races, they have used that time to reflect and forgive. Most halflings live peaceful lives, drinking and eating for most of their days, stirring up good times with instruments in hand. This race works hard just as much as they play hard, spending 2 days of the week working tirelessly in the mines, inventing, and cooking up delicious food. Being natives of Artheria, they have the most knowledge of cuisine. All throughout the land, even in elvish society, they have restaurants that sell their food. Legend has it that a small number of large conflicts have been solved by a bowl of halfling stew.

As such, most other races leave halflings alone, actively seeking them out for recipes and cooking advice. But make no mistake, a halfling can be useful in situations that require a small body. Halflings have been known to join the Adventurer’s Guild for a more exciting lifestyle, specifically in asset recollection or exploration. A few halflings know their way around the blade.

Humans
The most adaptable of the races, humans find their way into most societies as ambassadors. Much like the fairies, the majority of them learn their magic through using natural components and mana-infused items. Their adaptability has also led them to be conduits of magic, with the occasional human being able to cast spells from a magical deity or patron.
 Unlike their elven ancestors, the ability to manipulate magic does not come naturally to them. Although the ability to cast magic from within is still there, the occasional human being is able to do so after rigorous training and practice. 
Humans can be found living in almost every settlement of every race, their adaptability a universally prized trait. If a human is living among elves, their spellcasting ability must be greater than the surrounding elves. If they are living amongst the beastfolk, their relationship to animals must be practically magical. If a human amongst orcs, they must either be an outstanding fighter or just as merciless.
Humans are not only highly adaptable by behavior but by their genetic makeup. Records of Half-Orc, Half-Elves exist, as well as half-beastmen and half-tieflings, although with severe impairment. Half-Orcs and Half-Elves seem to be the most stable pairing.

Humans are the byproduct of Elves that were left alone to interbreed between themselves for millenia. Their crossbreed nature makes them adaptable.

Tieflings
Born from the First Warlock, Tieflings are looked down upon in human society and attacked on sight by Orcs. Their name comes from a term meaning ‘low’ or ‘deep’, as if the power given to them comes from an obscure entity that clawled from the dark depths of a terrible place. They have inherited their magical ability from the elves as was guaranteed in the promise, at the cost of their appearance. They are regarded as ill omens, their dark magic a reason for vigilance and caution. Most uneducated people in smaller towns are afraid of them on appearance alone, much like orcs or beastmen.
It is unclear which powerful entity their common ancestor gave his soul to, but a side effect of their gift is that they are strongly resistant to fire. A Tiefling can withstand boiling temperatures for hours and can even stand on fire for a long period of time before being burned.

If a tiefling is in a society that permits their residence, they are more often than not placed in the more dangerous part of town. Still, their resistance to heat makes them prized as firefighters. Their given talent for magic makes them excellent magic users, on par with elves. Unlike elves, the appearance of their casting is alarming. Their bright yellow or red eyes flicker with the shimmer of fire, their spellcasting voice deepens to an inhuman low pitch. Some say that the most powerful spellcasters dim the area of light, making their spells that much more intimidating.

During their inception as a people, some tieflings report visions of crossing into the dark planes, soaking in the mana of dark spirits. Their skin can range from a bright red to purple due to the alien habitat they were forced to live in, A kind of place where birds, fish and reptiles thrived. The brightness of their skin displayed that they are masters of fleeing. Their horns, from the animals that butt heads. Their small control of fire and vestigial tails, a remnant of the cold dark place their former spirits chose to live in.

Random Traits of Birth
Tieflings are born with various animal-like traits that appear demonic. Their people see these as different signs, and closeness to certain demons that they believe in.
The Vast majority of Tieflings have Horns and a tail. Some people celebrate this, other families who live in mixed societies find this detrimental. Other traits include:
Fur Length and Color
Additional Ears
Additional Eyes and Eye Color
Pupil Shape
More than one set of horns
More than one tail
Hooved Feet
Various tail type and length
Skin Color

Magic Casting Appearance
The Majority of Tieflings cast magic

Propensity to Wizardry, Warlocks and Magic.
Because of their people’s relation to magic, the Tieflings have an innate call to the dark arts. Forces outside their understanding protect them. Their ancestor, the Scholar (Or First Patron?) had developed never before seen summoning magic. As homage to this, Teiflings use Alchemy circles as identifiers for each other. Their letter signatures are often their favorite alchemy circle.

The Deamon Relationship
Different Colors, Magic. All disturbing and aggressive. Unsettling. 


Orcs
Orcs came into being from Humans. Humans used the knowledge of the fairies, using what they called ‘Ashen Magic’ to try and regain the ability to use magic. This was combined with the technology invented in Artheria. The spell ultimately failed, creating orcs. The spell corrupted the humans who ran the experiment, mutating them into a new type of sentient being.

Because of their degenerative bloodline, the majority of orcs are unintelligent and aggressive, making them the most despised of all the races throughout the land. They are unwelcome in most societies, the intelligent ones having to cover the color of their greenish skin.

The only accepted orcs are those of nobility, well known throughout the land as charming, strong, intelligent individuals capable of anything they set their endeavors on, provided they show proof of legitimacy. Often these nobility will go out of their way to dress in the best quality garments or armor they can find, decorated with their house’s symbol.
Despite this, Tieflings still look down upon them as much as other societies look down on them due to the current war.

Fighting an orc in combat is just as dangerous as fighting a wild animal, their natural physique letting them fight longer than even beastmen.

Orcs are often vying to show who the most capable house members are, joining any competition that will bring honor to their name. Some orcs attribute this to their nature, saying that even the most unintelligent orc wants to prove their might in combat for their tribe.

Orcish Colors
Skin can range from Human colors to dark green, almost black olive skin tone.
Degenerate Orcs choose to wear what is available. Their ripped clothing and discarded armors are stolen and poorly sewn together.

Noble Orcs choose to adorn their bodies and jewelries with colors that match their skin tone. Major colors are red, orange, brown, gray and gold.

Because of their population being majority degenerative orcs who are more brawn than brain, the Noble orcs (despite their Intelligence and mental adaptability on par with Elves), must prove their strength to their warring kin. Their armor is fierce, often blood soaked, battle worn and depicts the brutalism of war. The most savage of Orc tribes will have flags of living enemies, with limbs broken, their skin flayed, etc. kept alive until a suitable replacement can be broken down and dismembered in front of enemies.

The Noble Orcs in discussion with other intellectuals, despise this method of control. But better they do this, than someone who does this in joy. It is a necessary evil in the most brutal of Orc clans.

The more civil orc clans merely wish to display their strength amongst each other. Some Nobility were successful in channeling their habits to constructive events such as sports rallies. Thus, they can be crowned the strongest in a division, their competitiveness slaked.

Rumored Orc Clans (Former Unions)
House of Humies - Orc family with skin tone close to humans.
The Greyskins - Orcs who are active in caves with pale, ghoulish complexion.
Rockraiders - Tribes that mainly use stones
Bloodflags - Military Orcs that waive flags of various designs, always painted with red.
They paint their leathers with a red berry from a plant.

Ochre Ogres - Orc clan that worships a giant Ogre. They paint their skin and armor with a dull yellow color.

Steelmills - Orcs that settled to harvest steel. Their armor is the best out of all the Orcs.
Common Raiders - Feral Orcs that steal and pillage. Common.

Other Races
Because of ‘The Promise that Shattered the World’, other races have been documented traveling Caerne. Some come from the portals that have opened all over the continent (known as Portalites). These races are often stared at, either from a place of intrigue or distrust.

Wherever they find themselves, people usually form their opinions of them from the local gossip.

Extinct Races
Giants
	Twice the size of even the largest of beastmen or orc, the giants were a fearsome force to behold. The Scriptures say that the giants were slave mongers, believing that the leader is supposed to rule with might. They had 6 fingers, like 2 middle fingers of any humanoid being. Bones like iron, and could crush the throat of an elf with just 3 fingers.

The Giants went extinct during the Frozen Struggle, when the other races banded together to destroy them. Only scraps of information about the giants exist. One notable excerpt is that during the migration (before the Era of Ice), the Giant Soldiers always came from the North.

Similar to humans except their hands have six fingers, their bodies like wood. Savage sentient creatures that think of war, and do not believe in diplomacy. Their culture breeds the best warriors. Their culture has led to their numbers dropping. Estimated population is something like 5,000. They travel and live off giant animals. Their technology because of their culture has stayed in the Stone Age. They are a First Race, existing before the great migration.


Fairies
	The fairies were small, ferociously intelligent creatures that could sit on the palm of an elf’s hand. They had 4 wings like butterflies, except much thinner and longer.

These humanoids could cast spells with ease. Archeologists assert that the wings may have been vestigial, and that their wings were like sails that flew on the invisible currents of mana all around them.
It is documented that during ‘the passage’, the fairies lost their ability to fly. They also slowly lost their link to magic, their spells getting weaker and weaker as time went on. This could have been a potential catalyst to create technology that did not depend on one’s innate mana amount to function. They are a First Race, existing before the great migration.

An interesting excerpt about the fairies is that in ancient times, savage tribes would capture and grind up the fairies alive. When the fairies were killed in this way, bright lights of various colors would blast from their bodies, as well as emitting a stunning force that could knock out a grown man. This mixture would then dry for some time. Beastmen and Giants would snort this Fairy Powder, permanently imbuing them with the ability to use mana and cast spells at an unprecedented level.

The surviving tomes show diagrams of a single powerful fairy lifting giant trees and boulders using magic alone. The same diagram also shows giants burning freshly cut trees to smoke them out.

Changelings
Elven books say that for a short time, a small group of sentient humanoids existed along with the first giant and the first man. These creatures were called changelings, having the ability to change their appearance and genetic makeup at will to better adapt to their environment. Within a short time (days or weeks), Changelings could alter their teeth to become carnivorous or gills to breathe water. Most believe they are the proto-types of all races. Only scraps of information exist about them, some going as far as saying that they’re works of fiction by an ancient elf writer. If they did exist, they were left behind in the migration.

Spirits
Not exactly a race per se, but beings of pure mana that needed very little to survive. These spirits enveloped the first world, becoming living creatures once their form permanently stabilized. The books say some of them never changed form, drifting among other spirits that did stabilize.

Ancient elven books say that these spirits could have ranged from the size of an ant to a creature that stood above the largest of forests.

Timeline and Events

The First World
Titans of Creation
“Lower beings do not understand the scope, the machinations of life.
In them, worlds as worthy to life as they.
We are the gods of the existence within us
If such beings live within us, then we are but cells within a cosmic body.”
In the ancient elven scriptures, it is said that the universe was made by giants , their scale beyond comprehension. There may be a chance that the universe is a titan itself, and that the planet is just one cell among the trillions of cells that make up a titan.
Celestial Conflict
“In that vein of thought, a war of gods did happen.
For millennia they fought, the centuries mere seconds to them.
His split blood flowed rivers and oceans onto our world.
And from this blood, we were born.”
These titans fought each other for leadership over the other titans. They have godly sight, being able to see each individual creature. They fight for leadership to guide the universe into particular evolution. wielding impossible weapons and tools made of mana. Some Elven believers say that the clashing of the god swords was the spark of life.

Titanic Spirits
“We had to come from something. If that whole godblood thing is true, then spirits of all shapes and sizes ran right out those veins.”

Spirits roamed the world, shaping it as it is. These spirits adapted over time, becoming one with the land. The spirits are the basis for all landforms, all religions, and are the ancestors of all the races.

Changelings of the World
The first sentient beings, the proto-man. They resemble the spirits that they call their ancestors, slightly glowing in light. They could change their shape, but not their size; unlike their spirit ancestors.

The Fox God of the Beastmen
Rather than constantly change what they were, some changelings permanently took the form of the animals that we see today. The Beastmen are the linked between the changelings and the flora and fauna. Most Beastmen pray to the Rabbit God, a spirit that is responsible for the then high population of the Beastmen. They also worship their totem animal. 

Giants: The Children of Titans
The Giants believe that their ancestors were not spirits or changelings, but rather the last surviving titan couple. They have 6 fingers and round ears, unlike the elves. Because of their culture and location, Giants stayed in their Stone age, working together to bring down massive beasts bigger than them.

Elves of the Land
Elves believe that their ancestors were spirits that prospered in peaceful times. As such, they did not need to constantly change, and were fine with the form that they are now. This is why they can use magic, the ability of the spirits. They lead long lives, up to 1000 years.

Fairies of another Realm
So different from the Beastmen, the giants, Fairies are small sentient beings that resemble elves, save for their four wings and their intelligence to use the magic around them rather than within them. Fairies that use the magic within them have shorter lifespans than those that use the magic within the flora and fauna. Due to their size, they were often preyed upon by common animals. Elves used to associate fairies with the realm of spirits, thinking such small creatures can only exist in a place outside of reality.
The fairies had a symbiotic relationship with the Elves, at first indirectly. In both their histories, there is legend of the first friendship between them, which gave birth to magic that could heal.

The First War
The Giants were constantly at war with the beastmen for territory and food source. It was the beastmen first that contacted the elves, enslaving them in hopes of using their magical abilities. Resilient elves were used as living shields in their war against the giants. It is said that the elves betrayed the fairies. Tribes of beastmen would drink elven blood in hopes of gaining their strength. Through the elves, beast men made use of the fairies. Much like the way the fairies used the world’s mana, the beastmen grinded fairies up for their potions and combat magic.

The war transpired for many generations. This dwindled the population of all races, especially the elves and the fairies.

The Pendragon Lineage
Legends of an Elf bearing the name Pendragon. He was the one who organized battle tactics that freed his elven people and the Fairies. Together, the Elven-Fairy Collective created a magic-based technological society that kept the Beastmen/Giant Aggregate and the rampant spirits at bay. Pendragon was also able to use the wandering spirits in their favor.

Pendragon was said to be the first king. They used magic as the vehicle that enabled the invention of advanced weapons. But the giants and the beastmen had their own scholars, adapting to the technology of their former slaves.

As if the planet was fighting back, corrupted spirits born from the pollution rose, destroying the societies of both sides. 

This violence lasted for 800 years with the occasional unofficial ceasefires and broken truces. This is how they managed to follow the elves and the fairies across space. They had evolved from their stone age counterparts into a rough warrior society that could reverse engineer the Elven-Fairy Collective’s technology. The constant arms race created pollution that made monstrosities of the flora and fauna. Records of giant plants that swallowed giants whole. Forests were burned down, Landforms decimated for the sake of strategic positioning. The world became sludge as both sides used the land’s materials to feed the war machine.

Home Among the Stars
The Elven-Fairy Collective did what they had to do to survive as a species, faced against the strength of the Giants and the Beastmen.  They poisoned oceans, killed off the main food supply of the giants and the beastmen. They survived off the advanced elven agriculture technology. The mana that was meant for the natural world had become tainted with war. The trees that the beastmen cut down would grow back, devoid of color and mana. By the time the Elven-Fairy collective had the technology and the means to leave their planet, it was already corrupted beyond repair.

The Beastman-Giant Aggregate’s plan was to follow the Elven-Fairy Collective to a new world. The First World had already been lost to pollution and the wild, untamed spirits that rose up to protect it. Both sides loaded up a fleet of ships to not only fight each other but to carry as much supplies as they could for the trip.

Centuries had passed since the four races left the First World. The two factions fought off world numerous times while collecting supplies. Food and ship fuel is getting scarce for the Aggregate. They cannibalized their ships and population until only the largest ship, the Ark, survived. The Aggregate knew that if they stopped following the collective, both their species would starve in a defunct starship. There was no turning back. Infighting had broken some of the auxiliary systems of the ship, such as their planetary scanner. Without it, they could not scan a planet for a life-supporting environment. They followed the Elven-Fairy Collective from a distance until the Elves and the Fairies discovered a planet that had life on it. 

They named this planet Artheria.

Legend has it that on these ships, the last remaining pure spirits of the old world stowed away. They were known as the Fey. It was the only explanation they had for the magical phenomena that took place as the Elves and Fairies adapted to their new home. Elves once again felt the presence of their old gods within the lands.

Half-Men of Artheria
The Elves and the Fairies met the Halflings; a collective of sentient creatures with various lifestyles. These cultures were known as Gnomes, Dwarves, or just Halflings. Halflings then, were in their bronze age.
Halflings shared to the elves and fairies that the land is filled with elemental monsters and strange creatures that originate from The Grand Beholder. The Grand Beholder being a strange, fleshy floating creature with one giant eye and smaller eyes on stalks. There is only one.

To the West, giant reptiles with wings that can breathe the elements. Entire villages have been razed to the ground, lo

Decades had passed after the Collective made first contact with the Halflings. Then the Giants and the beastmen landed. When the collective informed the halflings about their enemy. The collective tells them that their enemy’s technology could bring down ‘entire worlds’ upon Artheria (referring to their homeship, but lost in translation). This knows this, because the Collective can do so as well.

The Roaming Elementals

Era of Ice
Years -2000 to 2000
4000 Years of Ice

The Great War lasted until the Era of Ice. Temperatures dropped, freezing soldiers solid in the winter months. The average temperature for the summer months, in the middle of the day, was 60F degrees. This meant that during Autumn,the temperature range for the 3 months of the season would be -10F to 30F. During winter, it would be -60F to 0F degrees for all three months. To be without fire for more than half of the year meant certain death. The fight for supremacy became a fight for survival. Many cultures made a ceremony for Summer and fire, often incorporating a bonfire of some sort.

Frozen Struggle
The era of ice drove everyone to desperation. The cultural nature of the giants to enslave became their downfall, as the other races banded together to genocide them. This was done by ‘destroying their Ark’. Shortly after, every race fought each other for the last remaining sources of food. It was here that the entire planet slowly lost access to the ancient technology that their ancestors created. The peace between the elves and the halflings ended.This was the last time anyone saw a giant, presumed extinct by the forces of nature. Fairies, due to their size, could not survive long. They too, disappeared from the textbooks of history.

Search for the Chalice of the Gods
There was a search for Godblood, stirred by the legends of the old world. Legends of a king ascending to godhood, and a prince that could never attain the title of king due to missing the Godden Chalice.
A kind of technology that was lost, along with the techniques of ;those before them’. A Chalice contained this godblood,and brave explorers traveled outside into the frozen wastes to find it. They say the chalice could end the Era of Ice. This period of desperation caused the destruction of much of the technology that came from the ancestors. All throughout Artheria are ruins and dilapidated structures. Adventures are sometimes tasked to go to these places to recover lost artifacts.

The Humans
The Elves began to give birth to elves with rounded ears. They lived short lives like beastmen, not even 1/10th of their Elven parents, who lived up to 1000 years.
 These humans were cast out from their Elven society, as they could not use magic. They created their own society from stone, with the help of the Halfling people. It was in this period that Humans and halflings discovered electricity. They thought it to be this world’s form of magic. This new discovery led to the founding of the ‘Library of the Wise’.

Humans for a time worshiped the same gods that the Elves did. Over time, the deities that they worshiped changed names as humans began to spread across the Caerne Continent. 
The Church of the First
9 Parts
Origin of the First
The Church of the First is a religion that can be traced to when humans were cast out from Elven society. It is believed that from a pantheon of Gods, there was Ein, the first. He was a winged creature that broke away from the corruption of his brothers and sisters. There was involvement of the Godsbath, thorns, wings and rings of protection. Gods of this pantheon must travel in pairs.

Ein chose the form of a mortal man, depicted as a human. He traveled the Caerne continent, doing good, improving the lives of fellow humans.

He believed that being human was to be the best for other humans, saving children from the unknown terrors of the night.

Traditions involve linking with others, being of service to them.

Higher forms of religion practice a yearly ritual of proving to their partner that they are still of service to each other.
In some cases of day to day practice, some humans are not able to help each other. This angers some higher members of the faith.

Symbols of the faith often take forms of Golden wings, rings, and a sacred blue fire.
Followers of the faith find that they can heal others with golden flames.

Attributing it to their elven heredity, Their collective belief in their deity gave them the elvish ability to use magic, but only as collectives. This began religion that eventually spread to other human societies. This behavior was not observed by the other races.

It was around this time that humans founded Nepenthe, a self-sufficient island. 

Birth of the Orcs
What humans lacked in their magical ability, they made up with by their intellect. Humans studied the books of the Fairies, learning to harness the world around them. In an attempt to regain the elven power, they dabbled in what the Fairies called ‘Ash Magic’. This tainted the humans, creating subhumans. They were called ‘Orcs’. 

Like their elven relatives, the humans casted orcs out of their society due to their aggressive behavior, large tusks and olive green skin. Or so the humans. Say.
There is speculation that what really happened was that the orcs were used as a labor source. Realizing their strength, they gathered together and rebelled, traveling far from the humans and started their own society.

The first orcs were not dumb, but their aggressive nature made their integration into human society difficult.

Inserted Jan 4th 2024 by Mike: The Orcish Confederation
(Spin off from British-American Confederation because I’m doing homework about it.)
Sick of the Humans and their impossible work quotas, the orcs took over a colony. Humans with Ashen magic tried to control them but they fought back.

They drew up something called the Oxen Union. It was the 6 colonies banding together as a new nation. They broke free from human king control.

House of Humies
The Greyskins
Rockraiders
Bloodflags
Ochre Ogres
Steelmills

Each Union had a leader, who was usually the strongest orc in the colony.

They gathered their plans.

“Orcs have to work for 18 hours a day? Fuck that.”

The Oxen Union Post:
We can make ambassadors that speak for the union leader. And treaty with other governments (even the humans) and the natives (the halflings)

The Post had 13 Notes:
We’re the Orc Confederation
The Colonies have powers not listed here
Colonies help each other in battle
Colonies can travel to and fro. Crimers get sent back for trial.
Each colony gets a vote. Can send a band to participate as envoys.
The 6 Colonies work with other allies.
Colonies pick their best fighter leader and draw them on a board.
Each colony makes a tribute to the confederation
Only the Confederation can make war and peace. They assign the ambassadors.
 The Green Ones: They act as the Elders when the Elders can ‘t make good choices.
Humans can join.
 Confederation will pay for past war debts (towards the elves for their assistance)
These 12 Notes can be changed if all 6 colonies voted unanimously.

There was no national army so the power was useless.
Separate from Militia (Monsters kept attacking the colonies.)



They can declare war

They make their own currency

Settle colony disputes

They traded with halflings since they’re the natives of the planet.

After some years, there was colony tension.
Some populations went up, yet that area only got the one vote for the Conferation. (Orcs couldn’t pronounce Confederation)
There was no judges so most disputes were duels
The orc confederation was just weak due to the articles imposed on itself.

Colonies made colony trades, but didn’t involve the Confederation. They lost funding, hence power.
Human goods were cheaper, so orc good makers and the economy suffered.

Reform was needed.

Some of the colonies were growing at incredible pacing. 
The Choice Room became 2 Choice room. 1 room for the 2-7 representatives to choose to select the one for the next Judgement room. The ‘voice’ would be the voice for a few moons, seasons.

A foolish orc said to continue the current system. His voice was removed.

Someone said to combine the best of the two ideas.

Stupider sentients were being used as slaved. They were considered 2/5th a person.






Tieflings: Of Demons and the Deep
The Orcs that were cast out from human society returned in large numbers. There was rage from being created, only to be shunned. A war between humans and orcs began. They burned down the Library of the Wise. Now known as the Ruined Library. A human scholar who could trace their lineage back to Pendragon, used his wealth and the last of Fairies Knowledge to summon a creature from another world to fight the orc invasion. It was known as The Patron, a being that spoke from the shadows in empathetic whispers.

A promise was made. The Scholar known as Pendragon agreed to this pact. This ‘demon’ would keep his family warm from the cold of the Era of Ice, and would give them the power of the elves, for a great price. 

The First Pact
This promise threw the world in disarray. Portals to other worlds began to open. The sun was blotted out in gray smoke for days. The Scholar realized what the smoke really was; the release of beings from the previous world.  Inexplicable events began to happen all across the continent, potentially the world. Events such as monstrosity citings, increased frequency of natural disasters, ect.  Some say that The Patron took this chance to bring its siblings into the world. A bedtime story once told to scare children is known as The Birth of the Possessor Demon, an occult explanation of some animals acting odd, hunting larger predators despite the animal in question obviously suffering fatal wounds.

That specific event was named:
“The Promise that Shattered the World”.

To this day, no one knows just how many demons were released by The Patron, or how many. Two portals have shown to be of benefit to peaceful society; The Fire Genasi Portal, and the Strixhaven Portal. Sentient beings known as ‘Fire Genasi’ emerged from their portal. They became citizens of Amethyst Peak. Their portal is well protected by the Royal Fire Brigade.

The scholar became the First Warlock to The Patron, summoning spirits from another reality from his tome of spells. The Human-Orc war ended, thanks to his immense power. Pendragon was hailed a hero for being instrumental to the war. He enjoyed the life of a celebrity, attending major events in human history. 9 months after the war was over, Pendragon disappeared.

The scholar sired many children during his time as a celebrity. News of his firstborn child emerged, it shocked the entire human race. It looked like a beastman but something else entirely with purple skin. Every single woman that the scholar was involved with gave birth to monsters that looked like the firstborn. Some of the women showed no signs of pregnancy until the last month of the Scholar’s appearances.

In some cases, these hundreds of scholar mothers were found strangled to death with what looked like a fiery, ever moving bruise around their necks and a weapon of some kind close to their monstrous children.

Over time, the mothers shared that these children seemed to be protected by a dark magic that they found nauseating and chilling, as if they were standing naked in the cold of the Era of Ice, sick from eating rotten porridge.
It was only on their child’s coming into adulthood that they felt this chill touch end.
One mother admitted to fearing their child, and managing to kill them in their sleep after her first period, when the chill touch had gone.

The children banded together after a few reports of their deaths. They felt a calling, moving into an underground mining cave that their father once used as a practice area. There, they founded their own town.

All tieflings can trace their lineage back to the first warlock.

The Patron also brought in a new school of magic never before seen; Necromancy. Most humanoids have seen elven magic similar to tieflings such as summoning fire, But never had they seen the atrocity of a dead creature come back to life.

The Scale of Amethyst Peak
The Founding
Anarch was a deity of Lachesism; a belief that one can be made better through a disaster that borders on traumatic. Thousands of years ago, during the Era of Ice, Anarch had traveled the continent of Caerne. On the Western part, along the mountain ranges, he hiked to the tallest mountain he could see, along with those who followed him. There, he drew inspiration from the tallest volcano nearby. It bled molten rock, red with the power to devastate anything in its flow. Anarch could not help but watch it.

Flying Beasts of Magic
As he watched the magnificence of it, he was witness to giant reptiles that flew overhead. This is the first sighting of Dragons. These enormous beasts could only fly through magical means. Anarch was sure of it. He felt it.

He watched the dragons as they gave tributes to the largest of their kind, a small group no more than two or five. He observed intelligence in these beasts. He named the larger dragons The Elder Dragons of Arcavios.

Anarch wanted their power for himself. They were like the living forms of the lava he had watched. They were powerful, unrelenting, ruling above their own kind. He wanted to tame them.

After taming these dragons, he used them as beasts of burden along with his followers to build the settlement now known as Amethyst Peak, right above the mountain that he studied. 

A thousand years passed. If there were any wild dragons left to take, Anarch did not know of them. The Elder Dragons had long since left. destroyed or having migrated elsewhere.

Dragonglass
dragonglass was always seen as just remnants of a dragon battle that ruined the land. But King Filo saw beauty in it. He loves the material so much he crafted his rapier out of it and this magical weapon only boosted his charisma


There is a settlement not far from Amethyst Peak named Dragonglass. It was called “The Town with Dragonglass” initially until people found it easier to just call it by the name of its chief export.

The crystal known as dragonglass is an interesting material ,used to create magical swords for the Jagged Edge Knights. It is just as durable as any metal, with no mention of the weapon ever shattering. When these knight grabbed onto this colorless glass weapon its magic would interact with their baseline emotion which gave it color.

Dragonglass Swords vary in color and take on many different properties. They can be of different size and weight, length and decor. To save material, the blade’s handle, hilt and pommel are usually made of obsidian or another type of metal and not the dragonglass itself. Although some Jagged Edge Knights request for the entire weapon to be one unbroken piece of Dragonglass. The blade can be translucent with a dim, consistent glow to it. Some knights have swords that have a constant bright glow to it that can be just as bright as a lantern.
Dragonglass also emerges from the hilt in various methods. Some blades may extend like a crystal suddenly growing, or shoot out in a beam of light.

Dragonglass Smithing is very time consuming compared to the time needed to create a traditional iron sword. To craft a single blade takes about a week.

 It requires the knowledge of a skilled glass artisan, a weapon smith, and 2 dragons. Many glass artisans and weaponsmiths can guess as to how the dragon glass is formed. Glass smiths speculate that it needs to be melted down, as with regular glass. But Dragonglass has been documented to retain its form even when doused in lava. And how would one sand the glass down to a razor sharp edge? Sanding down glass requires the use of a material harder than the object itself. If an object did exist, it would be used as a counter weapon to break dragon glass swords.

The exact method of its creation is a well guarded secret, known only by the few smithing families that create it. Hence, why most dragonglass smiths live along the nobles of Amethyst Peak. The material is hard to work with. But once it’s been crafted into a usual product, it fetches for an incredible price.

Dragon glass is used in all of the windows of Castle Blackthorne, providing it with a decoration that also doubles as a layer of defense against attacks. Only Castle Blackthorn could afford to install stained glassworks within the structure. Nobles that live around Castle Blackthorne are said to be able to afford only one dragonglass pane per generation. These panes are used to display the wealth of one’s family.




The Failed Conquests
Countless battles had been fought for the power that Anarch himself earned. With flying beasts that could breathe fire, every battle was won in his favor. Soon, Amethyst Peak became home to the greatest fighters and dragon riders. One notable battle was that between Amethyst Peak and Black Bay. They had failed. Since then, his settlement had become a symbol of strength and power to all other settlements. The castle walls not even once, touched by invader hands. 

The Rise of the Amereoux
Filo being the embodiment of “Lover not Fighter”
his skill is his charisma and ingenuity
His obsession with aesthetics and beauty proves to be useful because of his attention to detail
dragonglass was always seen as just remnants of a dragon battle that ruined the land. But King Filo saw beauty in it. He loves the material so much he crafted his rapier out of it and this magical weapon only boosted his charisma
Then during the war, before he was king, he knew that he didn’t have the fighting skills to help win the war. But he was confident in his ability to see the best in people. So he created a team of who he personally thought would be a great aid to the fight and he equipped each of them with a unique dragon glass weapon

The Current Monarchy
The kingdom's current ruler is Teofilo Blackthorn, known by various nicknames such as "The Bardic King" and "The Lute of Embers." However, his personal favorite is "Filo the Amereoux," bestowed upon him due to his reputation for engaging in playboy antics. His charismatic nature not only facilitated his romantic conquests, but it also played a pivotal role in rallying his army. King Filo's mastery of the rapier made him a formidable swordsman, yet his true gift lay in the art of Sword Dancing, which he used to inspire others. This exceptional talent, combined with his innate leadership abilities, led to his ascent as the king. Throughout his adventurous endeavors, he amassed a considerable number of lovers, demonstrating his broad-mindedness in his choices.

The Firstborn: Son of the Dragon Mother.
The mother of his first child bore an extraordinary secret. Saphira Maleys, a dragon who had been magically transformed into a human, became entwined in his life, leading to the birth of their son, Lance. Being the offspring of a unique union, Lance possessed the blood of both human and dragon, making him a formidable half-dragon. As he matured, his exceptional combat skills earned him the revered title of the Dragoon Knight of Amethyst Peak. Unbeknownst to many, Lance bore the rightful claim to the throne, yet he carried himself without airs of entitlement. Along his path as a warrior, he encountered Valka Tessarion, a skilled dragon rider, and their union gave rise to a daughter named Lancia, who would inherit the legacy of her remarkable lineage.

Flame Incarnates
Belial, the son of Alpas Urere, was born of an extraordinary lineage. His mother, an embodiment of the fiery essence known as a flame elemental, bestowed upon him the heritage of a flame genasi. In a fateful union, Belial married Eros Nefeli, an earth genasi, leading to the birth of their child, Biliran, who became a unique combination known as a lava para-genasi. Both Belial and Biliran shared a reputation as merciless combatants, aligning themselves with the ideology of Anarch. Unconcerned with the consequences of their destructive and chaotic fighting style, they displayed little regard for the collateral damage left in their wake. Belial, hailed as the Hellflame, and Biliran, known as the Scorched-Earth Soldier, became infamous figures, embodying their respective monikers.

No Need for a Queen
Within the kingdom, the court harbored deep-rooted prejudice, vehemently opposing the prospect of Lance ascending the throne and thereby paving the way for a future Queen in the form of Lancia, his rightful heir. Instead, their preference leaned toward King Filo's second son, Belial, for he already had a son of his own, Biliran. In their eyes, this ensured the continuation of the kingdom's traditional patriarchal rule.

In a sinister bid to thwart the possibility of a Queen's reign, the court devised a treacherous conspiracy aimed at eliminating Lance and his family. This calculated act would secure Belial's position as king, allowing the court to maintain their grip on power. However, Lance, ever watchful, caught wind of their nefarious plot. Recognizing the danger that loomed over his loved ones, he took the decisive step of sending Lancia to Strixhaven—a place where she could not only discover the truth of her birthright but also receive training to prepare herself for the eventual battle for the throne against her cousin, Biliran.

During her journey to the esteemed institution, Lancia, the true heir to the throne, received the shattering news of her parents' untimely demise. In a realm of uncertainty and intrigue, she realized that she had now become the Daughter of the Uncrowned King, burdened with the responsibility of reclaiming her rightful place in the kingdom's tumultuous struggle for power.

Word has traveled that Biliran has left the kingdom. This has inspired fear in the hearts of Amethyst Peaks’ enemies. Specifically Black Bay. People fear that a war may break out, due to Biliran’s reputation as a soldier.

The Iceless Frontier: For Aevelon
Year 1980.

The Era of Ice lasted something like 4000 years. When the humans were systematically cast out from elven society, they were just entering their copper age. Stories passed that someone had found the Chalice and used it to purify the world. The Era of Ice ended, beginning an era of relative peace.

The Halflings, Elves, Humans, Orcs, Tieflings and Beastmen began to intermingle and trade on the only discovered continent called Caerne. The Tria Prima was created, with the united manpower of all participating races. By this time, the Medieval Age began. Ranlean, Aralon and Amethyst Peak were founded.


Amethyst Peak Settled in the Year 1000
Kazka Zamir: The Tiefling Hero
Year 2000 

Kazka Zamir is a hero that emerged during his time with the Adventurer’s Guide. He traveled with a halfling who specialized in bombs, a large orc who was the Swordmaster leader of his first band, and his would-be lover Fumir, a fellow Tiefling Wizard. During the Era of Ice, it would have been impossible for such a party to form. The Halflings, Orcs, and Tieflings were in a racial competition for survival, due to the low amount of food caused by the cold.

Kazka’s party was known throughout the band, before the death of half the team. The first death was the halfling hero. While investigating a cave for monstrosities. They found Driders: Elves corrupted by the demonic forces that came from “The Promise that Shattered the World.”. They were hunted to extinction.

Other notable events in Kazka’s life is when he took down the Sea Serpent that was killing off the Halflings. He also destroyed a demonic weapon that took control of people, in order to create the perfect mechanical body for itself. It was known as the Scavenger Spear.

Childhood: The son of a famous warlock known as Kavik Zamir. He grew up in Aralon, a quiet town his father had decided to retire in after his decorated career in adventuring. His father’s fortune and fame came from his amazing feats as a powerful warlock. He retired soon after the death of his team and settled down. After Kazka was born he aimed to help him become the next greatest warlock. His childhood was far from rough, but his father, unfortunately passed away after introducing him to his patron. This is when Kazka learned the true cost of his father’s quest for power.

When his father was young he had made a contract with his patron that he would exchange power for pain and suffering to those around him. Although he was a great adventurer with great intentions he was unaware of how this pain and suffering would manifest. His quest for fame and fortune had blinded him from all the pain and suffering he had inadvertently caused. Like, the death of his team.

Former Teammates were Grum, the Half-Orc Fighter, Fumir the Sorceress, and Jerry the Halfling Rogue Bomber.



Return of War

War did return to Caerne, centuries later. The Orcish population proliferated faster than the other races. Orcs found that their bloodline was faulty. Orc women all over their society began to have children with degenerative traits. They cast out these defective, smaller orcs. These smaller orcs returned like pests. They are now known as goblins. Like their Orc ancestors, their population grew exponentially, until they could be found raiding hamlets throughout the land.

They began to seek answers for their stillbirths and the goblin disaster from the colleges. Their history with the humans as well as their predatory physique made their society untrusted throughout the land. Their population began to degenerate. Their society fell apart, fracturing into smaller societies until they became tribes of raiders and pirates. Tiefling societies were the first to be consistently raided.

A bloodline of orcs that retained their intelligence became the nobles of their society, forced to lead their feral brothers and sisters until they can solve their degenerating gene issue.

The Tiefling-Orc War was the catalyst for the Adventurer’s Guild. At first, it was a call to arms for mercenaries to fight for the Tieflings, but in time converted to a guild that sent agents out for profit. They specialize in war contracting, exploration and asset recollection.

The Adventurer’s guild is actively searching for the Chalice that was said to have ended the Era of Ice. It is said to reside in a place called Aevelon.

The Guild has also dispatched many adventurers to unexplored continents, but no adventurer has yet to return.

The Ephemerals of Nepenthe

01 The Island of Nepenthe
Nepenthe was a self-sufficient village on a secluded island. It was once filled with a youthful whimsy and its inhabitants often lived long, healthy lives. The land was fruitful and the plants were tinted with brilliance.
However, Nepenthe and all of its radiance faded away after it was invaded by the Arresters. The Arresters enslaved the aboriginals and this would be their life until the conquistadors could find the Seed of Thithonus.

02 The Seed of Thithonus
Thithonus was once a mortal man who was granted eternal. life. Unfortunately, he was not blessed with eternal youth and he is now forced to live an endless life in old age. He has since aged to a point where he can no longer move his body. Legends state that, in an attempt to combat his curse, he created a seed that would grant him eternal youth. Although it is unconfirmed if he was successful in this endeavor, the seed is thought to reside in Nepenthe.

03 Invasion of the Arresters
The Arrestors are a group of conquistadors on a quest to find the Seed of Thithonus. They believed that, with the power of immortality, they'd be able to grow their armies and conquer all of man.
The search for the seed had led them to Nepenthe where they pillaged the land and enslaved its inhabitants. They are determined to find the seed and until then, they aim to wreak havoc on the island with hopes that the seed will reveal itself.

04 Anarch, Vellichor, & Petrichor
Among the tribe were three young Aasimars who differed from the others: Anarch, Vellichor, and his sister Petrichor. They were born into a life of slavery, but were convinced that this was not the life they were meant to live. Anarch was rebellious in nature and often defied the Arresters and their demands. This behavior would have been his undoing if it wasn't for his best friend, Vellichor, a calm and collected scholar. Petrichor, unlike the other two, was an extrovert who was enamored by her very existence and lived a life of unconditional compassion and kindness.

05 The Evergreen Sapling
Petrichor, with her charming naivety, frequently described the beauty of a tree that would grow if the Seed Thithonus had ever been planted. Vellichor, however, found truth in this dream despite his hyper- logical mindset.
Believing that this was their only way of surviving an escape, Anarch and Vellichor searched all of Nepenthe until they found what must be the immortal tree that Petrichor envisioned. It was colossal in size and was decorated with leaves so vivid they seemed to give off a glow. Its trunk was that of a sapling and the only evidence of age was its size.

06 Leap of Faith
During their search for the mythical tree, the trio was unknowingly followed by an Arrester who was unsure of their intent. Anarch grew suspicious after spotting an extra set of footsteps on their trail. Upon the potential discovery of the Evergreen Sapling, Anarch heard the approaching Arrester and felt that they needed to act quickly. He took a chance, stabbed the trunk, and licked the sap off of his blade. He urged the other two to do the same and jumped off the 100 foot cliff. into the ocean. Vellichor had attempted to collect as much sap into a vial when the Arrester had called out to them. He and Petrichor both sipped from the vial before he grabbed her and jumped.

The Ephemerals
After witnessing the trio make their jump, the Arrester chased after them towards the edge of the cliff. He peered over the edge, examined the drop, and saw no signs of life in the ocean nor did he see any chance of survival. He reported back to his leader who labeled them "The Ephemerals" due to their short-lived existence.
Back at the cliff side, bubbles rose to the surface of the water. Through the ripples in the sea, the trio emerged, seemingly unscathed. They swam to the nearest shore where they would finally experience life. This marked the immortal rebirth of the Ephemerals of Nepenthe.



------------------------------
After The Era of Ice (Artheria's Ice Age) ended, every known community began to go out and explore that which was frozen in ice and snow. This was known as the Iceless Frontier.

The Adventurer's Guild was formed. No longer just an organization of sellswords, they began to help build communities through discoveries, logistics, and organizing friendly relations with various communities that lost touch with each other during the Era of Ice. They helped bring protection and structure in the New, Lawless world of Artheria.

Eli and Argo had been employed at a tavern for a short period, earning 16 silver each. However, they were soon entrusted with a new task by the tavern keeper's brother, who worked as an excavator. Along their journey, they stumbled upon an injured horse and valiantly rescued it. Continuing their quest, they eventually located the excavator and successfully solved two challenging puzzles. As a result, they reached an agreement to receive one-third of the discoveries made during the excavation. With this session coming to an end, they concluded their day's work.

In the second part of their endeavors, Jasoon and Yoshua, acquaintances from restorative college classes in a bustling town, decided to forgo studying and engage in mischievous activities, playfully tossing objects and exerting a negative influence on each other. However, Yoshua eventually departed, lured by the call of a passing tribe of barbarians, who claimed to be on a path toward physical strength and improvement.

After Jasoon acquired knowledge of healing magic at the college, fate brought him and Yoshua together again. Yoshua had been abandoned by his tribe for neglecting cardiovascular exercise and leg training during battles with their enemies. Following a night of heavy ale consumption, the two made a solemn promise never to part ways again and embarked on a journey to aid others and "secure more gains," as Yoshua eloquently put it.

During a robbery incident outside a bar, Eli, also known as Elikaen, found herself in a precarious situation. However, her rescue arrived in the form of Argo, a small Gnome who gallantly fought off the assailants due to their despicable appearance. After sharing some drinks, they realized that the town held nothing more for them.

Recognizing a shared connection, they decided to travel together. Argo sought to overcome the haunting nightmares of past traumas, while Eli pursued the elusive figure known as "The Betrayer."

As the two parties debated the correct route to a nearby town, they were suddenly attacked by bandits. Acting swiftly, the four individuals joined forces and made a hasty retreat to avoid further confrontation. Injured and depleted of mana, they now needed to find a safe haven to rest and plan their next course of action.

Chapter 1: Kindred Spirits

Argo's Journal Entry

Satur, 19th Septum, 3020 (2 Days Ago)

The voices grow louder, more persistent.

Some nights, I manage to find solace, only hearing the occasional sound of a baby's gentle cry from a nearby crib. On those nights, I can find some semblance of sleep.

But last night, it was different. The anguished wails of a grieving mother pierced the air, as if she had suffered a tragic loss.

Perhaps it's something about this city, this town that amplifies the voices within my mind.

I have made up my mind. I am leaving. This is my final decision. I will take up odd jobs along the way to earn a meager coin and keep myself alive. My body is strong and nimble; it can endure the hardships.

I am heading East, where rumors speak of a tranquil and serene land. A place where the nights are cool, the days are warm, and the peace will drown out the tormenting voices within.

Eli's Journal Entry

Satur, 19th Septum, 3020 (2 Days Ago)

For weeks now, I have been diligently tracking a group of five riders. Their leader, a large man with a silver mane of thick, graying beard, stands out among them. One of his companions sports a peg leg. They are headed East.

I have been tailing them, step by step. But my supplies are running low, and I find myself with only nine coppers left to my name. I spot a tavern up ahead, its signs indicating development and potential opportunities. Perhaps they are in need of assistance.

1: Delivering to a Ruin Seeker

Argo and I meet at the tavern, and fate intertwines our paths. We work there for a few days until the tavern owner sends us on a mission to aid her sister, Malachi. Along the way, we come across a wounded horse and extend our help, naming her Macy. Finally reaching Malachi, we unravel two perplexing riddles and gain entry into an Elven dungeon.

Puzzle:
"Speak my name, and I am broken. Seldom heard, and never spoken."

"Trust not your eyes, for they hold you back. Believe not your mind, a sound obstruction. Swift as the wind, for stillness you lack. The way is open, a ghost's construction."

2: Yoshua, Half Orc

Yoshua's Journal Entry

Satur, 3rd Octor

Fuck. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. Fuck, in all caps.
Dear Journal; FUCK.
St. Gabriel and I have lost our way. We heard rumors of treasure hidden within ancient Elven ruins. I thought it would be a grand adventure, a chance to earn coin for quality meat to fuel my gains.
But we lost St. Gabriel. He fell into a hole.
I have been stranded here for a day now. Shit, I'm starving.

Elikaen's Notes:
Eli's thoughts on St. Gabriel

Maybe the gods are more flexible with what one can achieve. Perhaps it is the constraints of organized religion that hold back those who are destined for greatness.


Eli's thoughts on Argo:

Eli finds herself placing more trust in St. Gabriel compared to Argo, primarily because of the unsettling night terrors that Argo experiences. The presence of these nightmares raises doubts in Eli's mind. Argo's lack of complete honesty also conflicts with his usual character, leaving Eli uncertain about who Argo truly is. The trust she once had in him begins to waver, making her question whether Argo is the person she initially believed him to be.





Yoshua's Encounter and the Battle with the Dryad

After a day of being stranded, Yoshua's luck took a turn when he stumbled upon the same hole where he lost St. Gabriel. To his surprise, he found Eli and Argo waiting nearby. Eager to test their strength and determine if they were worthy companions, Yoshua challenged them to a fist fight. Through a heated brawl, the trio proved their mettle, showcasing their skills and determination.

During their exploration, they came across an Orcish Sword, a formidable weapon that Yoshua claimed as his own. Empowered by this newfound weapon, they continued their journey deeper into the wilderness, where they encountered a menacing Dryad. A fierce battle ensued, and with their combined efforts, they managed to defeat the formidable creature.

Amidst the aftermath of the battle, they discovered an intriguing Elven Ring adorned with a striking green gem inlay. Recognizing its potential significance, they kept the ring as a valuable artifact.

Reunited with Malaci, the brother of the tavern keeper, they shared the news of their encounters and victories. Malaci, impressed by their prowess and bravery, welcomed them back and celebrated their achievements. The group's bond grew stronger as they prepared for the next chapter of their journey, united in their shared experiences and the treasures they had acquired.

3: Finding St. Gabriel


Emerging from the Elven ruins through a different entry point, the group is met with surprise by Malaci upon seeing a half-orc among the two individuals he had initially sent in. Confusion turns into a conversation about rewards, with the group expressing their desire to be taken back to Malaci's sister.

During their journey, they cross paths with Yoshua's best friend, St. Gabriel, who offers his healing abilities to tend to their wounded horse. Impressed by St. Gabriel's skills and the bond he shares with Yoshua, the group welcomes him into their fold.

Eventually, they reach their destination where Malachi awaits them, ready to fulfill his promise of rewarding their efforts. As the group celebrates their achievements, Yoshua makes an attempt to forge a romantic connection.

However, their peaceful moment is interrupted by the arrival of an injured Tiefling man seeking help. After providing him with much-needed rest, the man reveals a harrowing tale of a band of horsemen who had previously attacked him. In a twist of fate, the group avenges the Tiefling's suffering by eliminating the band's members, including the man's own children. Overwhelmed by grief, the man flees, intending to return in a few days to bury his family.

With heavy hearts, the group finds solace in a well-deserved rest. Yet, their dreams are plagued by haunting memories and significant moments from their pasts.

Yoshua dreams of the Paladin-Barbarians who once abandoned him, hindered by a boulder blocking his path, a symbol of his perceived inadequacy.

St. Gabriel recalls his mentor, Rafael, who entrusted him with a censer and urged him to embark on a pilgrimage, leaving a mark of soot on the chain as a testament to its frequent use.

Argo's dream transports him back to the raid on his village, where he sits beside his parents, confronted by a raider who belittles his perceived weakness before riding off, leaving destruction in his wake.

Eli's dream harks back to a journey with her mentor to a sacred tree, where a ritual was performed. Though the specifics remain hazy upon awakening, she senses a profound connection and conversation with her mentor.

As the night draws to a close, the group awakens, carrying the weight of their dreams and memories, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead.


With the addition of St. Gabriel to their party, the group sets out on their journey to fulfill Malaci's request of being taken to his sister. Along the way, they come across St. Gabriel, Yoshua's trusted hometown friend and traveling companion, who joins them after using his healing skills to tend to the wounded horse, Macy.

Together, they escort Malachi back to his sister's bar. However, upon their arrival, they notice a certain level of affection between Malachi and his sister, hinting at a deeper bond between them.

During their stay, a wounded man stumbles into the bar, sharing a tragic tale of his family being attacked. He recounts how they showed mercy to a band of horsemen, only to be betrayed in return. The man's children were mercilessly slain before him, leaving him devastated. Determined to seek justice, the group learns that among the raiders, one of them has a distinctive peg leg.

Continuing their journey eastward, the group's attention is caught by the glimmer of a toolbelt. Eli expertly climbs and retrieves it, handing it over to St. Gabriel, who opens it to find a valuable Chainmail shirt worth a significant amount of gold. They proceed to reach the village of Aralon, a modest town offering various establishments including a Tavern Inn that serves non-alcoholic beverages, a weapon shop, Wizard's Corner owned by Magister Greer, Granny Smith Fruits and Veggies, and the Chapel of the First.

Upon arrival, the guards at the town's entrance express suspicion towards Yoshua due to the presence of a nearby clan of barbarian-paladins. However, they allow the group to enter after noticing St. Gabriel's emblem of the First, signifying his affiliation with the church.

In their explorations within Aralon, the group attempts to recruit a pet from Granny Smith's collection but finds that all the animals are too attached to her to leave. The selection includes a donkey, a bear, a horse, and even a giant spider. Adjacent to Granny Smith's place, they encounter a tent housing various magical items. Curiosity draws them closer, and as they approach, they notice a rooster perched on the table, pecking at seeds.

Yoshua, seizing the opportunity, grabs the rooster by the neck, attempting to enlist it as part of their crew. To their astonishment, the rooster unexpectedly speaks in common language, exclaiming, "WHAT THE FUCK-HEELLLLP!"

The guards arrive. They see Yoshua choking the rooster, calling the bird 'Magister Greer'.The guards nod to each other. One approach is to have Yoshua release the rooster. The other draws his sword.A figure peeks out from the Church of the First window, attracted by the commotion. Yoshua lets go. The Magister transforms into human form, ushers them all away. Greer retaliates at the group by charging exorbitant prices. They all leave, but Eli manages to pilfer a scroll of Identify. A Wizard could learn this spell and add it to their spellbook; unfortunately, no one in the group is a Wizard. 

St. Gabriel enters the church. Priest Padre recognizes Gabriel as the student of Archfather Rafael. He asks if Gabriel recognizes him, as they met before when Gabriel was a child. Gabriel only remembers that Priest Padre is weirdly good at fishing. Priest Padre entrusted St. Gabriel with a letter, and 5 plague masks. He sends him off to do good and spread the word of the First by helping those affected by the plague. in the Town of Ranlean. . Gabriel returns, reporting what happened in the church to his team. Argo goes to the busker just outside the inn. It's a blonde human, who's strumming her lute and humming along with her eyes closed. Argo sneaks a catchy melody, which inspires the busker to play louder, to start singing. When she opens her eyes, she sees that she's attracted a crowd. She greets Argo, who she's known from Autumn Fields, their hometown.

Danielle, a fellow street urchin who grew up in the same situation. She remembers sharing a loaf of freshly baked bread with Argo; one of her fond memories. She mentions a sight to see just outside of Aralon; a traveling tavern, with tents set up just outside of it. She'll be there tonight, if Argo needs to see her. Looking at Argo's friends, she looks at Eli. Mentions to her that she reminds her of someone. A man with black and white hair. Eli shakes her head, asking who she thinks she is. Danielle takes her leave. Argo throws her one of his wooden coins. She playfully bites it, saying it's the real deal. She takes off, leaving the group.

4: Travelling Tavern and Dangerous Roads

Travelling
10-12 days, 304miles




As the group discusses their individual motivations, St. Gabriel expresses his dedication to aiding the plagued town of Ranlean on behalf of his church. Eli shares her determination to head eastward in search of something important to her, while Argo emphasizes the need to find solace from the voices in his head, willing to follow anyone who can provide that. Yoshua, ever focused on meat and gains, enthusiastically agrees to accompany St. Gabriel on his mission.

Remaining in Aralon, the party takes the opportunity to stock up on supplies, aware of the long journey ahead. Following Argo's suggestion, they make their way to the Traveling Tavern, surrounded by a few accompanying tents. As they approach, a man in noble clothing exits one of the tents but quickly retreats upon seeing the group. Shortly after, three women leave the same tent.

Eli approaches two tieflings, noticing a dagger on one of their hips while they exchange glances with Yoshua. Speaking in Infernal to maintain secrecy, the tieflings share information about having seen the group's horse, Macy. They explain that their own friends were recently attacked by mounted assailants and initially mistook the party for their attackers. Yoshua convinces them otherwise by performing a magic trick, putting their apprehensions to rest.

St. Gabriel successfully persuades the tieflings to travel with the group toward the east, adding more strength to their party. Argo inquires about Danielle, capturing the attention of the barkeep who acknowledges her beauty. Shortly after, Danielle makes an appearance, stepping out of one of the nearby tents. She engages the party in a drinking contest, where Argo and Yoshua end up getting drunk. St. Gabriel and Eli participate but drink more moderately, with Gabriel stopping after just one drink due to his church's disapproval of alcohol consumption.

At dawn, the group sets out on their journey. Along the way, they spot what appears to be treasure. Yoshua, ever drawn to shiny things, attempts to reach it. However, St. Gabriel uses his detect trap ability and senses that the treasure is not what it seems. Cautiously, Yoshua steps back and decides to use a rope tied to a javelin to retrieve the backpack-like treasure. To his surprise, the javelin slips through the rope, causing the backpack to sink into the ground—a cleverly concealed wooden spike pit trap. Meanwhile, arrows narrowly miss the group, alerting them to the presence of bandits. Argo is grazed by a knife, but St. Gabriel swiftly heals his wound, demonstrating his healing prowess.


The encounter with the bandits ends swiftly and decisively. Argo incapacitates one of them with a punch to the groin, and Eli skillfully dispatches another with a thrown dagger that cuts his carotid artery. Yoshua uses a mysterious metal tool to dislodge a chunk of rock from a boulder, causing it to fall and crush one of the bandits.

Yoshua commands the remaining bandit to run, but as he turns his back, Yoshua swiftly cuts him down, severing his ankles and hips before butchering him into smaller pieces.

Meanwhile, Argo climbs a tree to locate the last bandit, an archer hiding in the trees. St. Gabriel spots the archer and warns Argo of the danger. Acting quickly, Argo throws a dart with a rope attached, connecting it to a nearby tree. As he falls, he wraps the noose end of the rope around the tree he climbed. Using a piton, he turns the rope into a makeshift zipline.

The fleeing archer bandit is hit by Eli's boomerang, and Yoshua's revolver removes his left testicle. Argo throws his boomerang, initially missing, but it returns and strikes the bandit, destroying his remaining testicle and causing it to rupture between his femur.

After the battle, the group searches through the bandits' belongings and discovers signs of their desperation and starvation. Their emaciated rib cages indicate they were forced into raiding as a result of dire circumstances.

Danielle returns and informs the group that the barkeep lashed out at his horses, hoping to deter any potential raiders. The party sets up camp with Danielle joining them at the fringes of the campfire. Eli takes the first watch of the night and is visited by her patron, a being she hasn't encountered in a long time.




Elikaen 1: The Patron Bina



Eli is called to a grove close to the camp. It wasn’t there before. This is the grasslands, after all.

In the center, a dead tree. Taking a closer look at it, a humanoid figure is pressed against the tree, her appearance resembling theatre makeup, as if she’s playing a tree or a dryad. Eli bows to the figure. The figure looks to her, slightly annoyed.

“Oh, you’re no fun.”

Eli stands up at the figure’s gestures. The figure passes her hand across her face. The makeup disappears as soon as her hand passes through. She’s now wearing a skintight jester suit, with blue and green diamonds all over it. The trim  sparkles. The figure spins and dances, doing cartwheels while talking to Eli. She asked why Eli hadn't come to her. “My name is Bina. I am the source of your powers.”

Bina
“This group that you travel with, these men… are they any fun?”

Eli
“I like the small one. And the big one is entertaining.”

“Oh you like the small one? I wonder if you would say the same if you knew where he’s from, what he’s done.”

Eli
“We all have to do what we must.”

Bina
“It won’t help, you know. Finding him. You can’t rewind time. There’s no promise that your life before him would have been any good. Take this from someone who’s lived a loooooooong time.

Eli
“So what should I do?”
*She has a look across her face, showing consideration for her advice.*

Bina
“Your life is your own, you are free to do as you wish.”
*She casts a coy look, a grin on the corner of her mouth.


While doing a front somersault, her suit falls apart at the legs. It becomes a dark green masquerade dress, wide at the hips with billowy silk. She’s wearing a porcelain mask that completely covers her face, only her bright hazel eyes are visible.


Bina
“A question. A serious one at that.”
“Your life after you catch him. After expending justice... What does your life look like?”

Eli
“I… I don’t know.”

Bina
“Hmmmm.”
*Her expression is neutral.

Bina
“...I want to show you something. I haven’t been fair to you. 
You can control fire, yes? maybe even make a few ice cubes. I saw it when you attack one of our own, a the dryad. Burned her bark, threw oil at her. Froze that bandit just earlier today. Did they deserve it, really?”

*She fixes her masquerade dress to sit on a rock, neck exposed to Eli.

Eli
“...”

Bina
*She flashes her a disapproving grin.
“Well. I trust in your decision. I’d like to help you in your aspirations.
*She walks away. The dewy fog of the night seems to thicken. Bina disappears in the fog. Reappears a good distance farther away. 

She’s now in a humble daily dress, sleeves pulled up. Her thick, light brown hair falls to one shoulder.

Bina
I’ll teach you that. Or…

She gestures as if putting on a mask. When she takes it off, she’s gone. She disappears.

Bina reappears behind Eli. She’s  back in her jester suit, juggling colored felt balls without effort. 


She stops her juggling to teach Eli some of her spells.

“My magic depends on illusion. Redirection. At times it requires you to be loud and dazzling so that the real magic is quiet and subtle. Much like the b in subtle. For you to move like the mist, you must say these words… Yes, good, good. Now to disappear as I do, say these words, and rub your eye in such a way where only a single eyelash falls off. Imagine that you are in front of a mirror, looking into your own eyes. Wear that mask, yes, that one. The one that you’ve put between you and the natural world. Gracefully, take it off. Surrender to the wind that soars between the pines. Be the moth, flush against bark. Invisible to the hunter of those who seek you the still moth.

Eli picks up the spells quickly. Bina dances and spins, elated to see Eli disappear and reappear.

Bina
“Okay. I’ve helped you. Now... you help me.”

“I’ve run out stories to tell. My dance, my vigor...it’s become lackluster. I need inspiration.

...I want you to play matchmaker. Help a couple or two fall in love! Theater has, and always will be, the eternal song of warm bodies in the night. You can’t guide those in your party! Far too easy, it has to be true love.

It’ll keep my mind off my ex and his rival.”

Bina appears, face to face, inches away from Eli’s.
“I’ll be watching, dear. Toodles.”

She begins to throw the balls at Eli, they even make a whiz sound as they fly by. When she looks again, Bina is gone. Three circular stones are stacked where she used to be.



5: Journey to Ranlean
Group of airships pass overhead. Group sees that it’s damaged. It heads South East.
A wagon bearing a black stone hex symbol passes by. It’s mostly amazonian women wielding stone clubs. They trade for one of Yoshua’s swords at 7gp. They also tell of their religion, being worshippers of 2 twin gods whose home in the clouds had been corrupted by a betrayer god. Their twin gods had fallen, creating their own home in columns of basalt.

Argo 1: The Spirit



Argo, who had been tasked to keep watch, wakes the group to a lime green figure in the distance. Eli and Yoshua pretend not to see it. St. Gabriel pretends, but is caught.

A ghost takes a corporeal form as a burned woman and pack of cloth. Lime green flames. “Baseplate, Bezel, Arrow, Needle. Baseplate, Bezel, Arrow, Needle. Soak the cork, destroy the evil.” She says over and over and over again. She points further East, then disappears.

They reach Ranlean, and go right to the church as guided by priest padre. They see coffins and a few church elected guards outside.

Yoshua tries to take the cart that some bodies are loaded onto. The guards rush over in a panic. They see St. Gabriel and his symbol. They ask what he’s doing there, and why the big one is taking their cart full of diseased dead in a sarcastic manner. Gabriel responds that he and his friends need the cart for their adventure. When Eli controls the flames towards the bodies, the guards panic even further, moving away as they think they could catch the plague that’s going on.

St. Gabriel enters. He meets Chorbishop Cali.


Cali receives the 5 plague masks and the letter. She reads it, then nods. Asks St. Gabriel to go North of Ranlean, take 2 dead bodies to the Rot Wizard. They accept.

Along the way, they see Dwarven ruins. The door is untouched.St. Gabriel understands this as no one’s been there, and the treasure is still inside.

They go in.

The place is dark. Incredibly dark. The party marches with the only person without darkvision in the center. They are hit with rock traps. On their left, a bucket with cheese. They decipher that mouse have eaten from it.

Bridge
Upon finding a rickety bridge, Yoshua asks Argo to come closer. He suddenly throws him over the bridge. He takes a little damage from the fall.



 Episode 5 Ghost appears Guys see an airship after battle far South East Pass through a group of women in black, state themselves as House of Basalt Arrive at the other Church of the First Yoshua takes the cart. the guards out front are visibly upset by this When Eli uses magic, the guards panic. "Just go see Chorbishop Cali inside." St. Gabriel goes inside. talks to the chorbishop. Tells him of the plague that's been spreading. It affects magic users only. Chorbishop gathers the party. "Take these two bodies for examination to the Rot Wizard. North of here, just a day's travel away.


 Along the way, broken ruins along the road.


 The group travel in. after kickin in a series of doors and bypassing a rickety wooden bridge, the group discover a library of sorts.


They read a journal to the right of the library. In an old language and in messy handwriting, Eli reads it as the journal of someone who takes a humanoid form and kills librarians. takes their books home to this place. They find in various coinpurses: 15gold 3 Silver 3 Copper The group find 5 books: -Yellow Blood: A Book of Necromancy -A Book on Blue Dragons -The Autobiography of an Elven Religious figure -History of Lostia (eastern part of where they are). -Apparitions: Spirits book
:
 A green creature that can disappear and change her form appears. She attacks the group
This witchlike creature has rough green skin, greasy hair. mud cakes her feet.


 DM's Blunders "As you travel along the road, you see another group of travelers, a wagon that's all black. black wagon canvas, dark grey wood, they wear black robes. One of them is a hulking half-orc, possibly full orc." (SG) "Okay." "Roll a religion check." (SG) "Why"



The bridge falls after Yoshua runs through it. St. Gabriel and Eli traverse over the gap by using rope. Argo helps by deploying his grappling hook and rope.

They enter a library. On the right of the library, a journal of dirty handwriting. It’s the journal of something that kills librarians.

They find several little rooms filled with books. After discovering a good handful of coins, they find five books.





Yellow Blood: A study of Necromancy
Scales of the Shore: A Blue Dragon Informational
Friar Birel Lialdon: Life of a Elven Follower
Eastern Affairs: War of the East
Farm Beasts: Goblins and other similar folk

A creature attacks, resembling an old woman.

She lets out a shriek as the group attacks her.
The party has seen her go invisible, as well as transform into Yoshua.

6: The Ruins
The call of the green hag has summoned rats, notably a giant rat. Its weight forced the party into the basement of the ruins. It took 6 hours to find the exit, and four hours to pull the wagon to where the Rot wizard should be.

The group take a short rest after having escaped the ruins. Having taken 6 hours to find the exit and 4 hours to travel towards the Rot Wizard, they take a short rest.

------

As the group lean against dead trees and small boulders, they begin to question their trust in each other.
St Gabriel and Yoshua have considerable trust in each other having gone to academy together. Though the time apart may have changed them in unforeseen ways.

Saint Gabriel and Yoshua ask Argo about his background, and learn that he comes from a squalid background; life on the streets.
Family and Village were massacred.
Yoshua asks why he's chosen the life of a bard, and why he does his rituals. Backflips and Drumming.
Argo: I do them because I can.
St Gabriel: Something's up with that.
...

Yoshua:
So, are you two a thing?
Eli
Hell no, we are not a thing. He is just entertaining.
Eli: We've been travelling together for a while, but can we really trust each other?
Yoshua
Listen, I picked y'all up to dodge danger. I'm trustworthy. As proof, here's protein shakes.
Yoshua hands his protein shake rations to each member.
...

Eli to St Gabriel: What do you know of Night terrors?
St.: NIght terrors, huh? It's a manifestation of a negative energy in one's life. It comes in many ways, shapes and forms, but does form as a kind of compensation, Why do you have night terrors?
Eli: No, can you help Argo with night terrors? He bothers me when I meditate at night and I can't get proper rest.

St. to Argo:  Oh, it's you who has trauma? I said it before, it's a manifestation of something negative in your life. Is it caused by something in your past? I would advise to release and rid it from your life; let it go. You'll find more peace of mind if you do. What do you think it is?

Argo: Hmmm...Let's not talk about it right now.

....

Eli to Yoshua: You mentioned you were part of a group, barbarians or paladins. They left you because you didn't want to work on your lower body and cardio. Why don't you do leg day?
Yoshua: Hey, I got us out. It was because of my developed upper body that I managed to get us out. I'm not too certain, but it seems I have some sort of mental block when it comes to the strength in my legs. I work on my upper body to compensate for the mental block that I seem to have on my legs.

...

Eli: What about you, St. Gabriel, where do you get your power? What are you after?
St: After getting the title, to be ordained.
St.: I thought I already was, but I wasn't. 
Eli: Why is your power in your button but not your ability? What can you do with the button? What can’t you do? What spells can you cast? 
St Gabriel
Does this pin restrict me? It restricts me, it gives me a code to follow. 
Eli: Why does status mean so much to you? Why do you put so much power into this pin rather than your own abilities?
St. Gab: I've committed so much to my identity as a member of the First Church, only to realize i was not ordained. My mentor may not be who I thought he was.
Being on this pilgrimage gives me direction.

----



St. Gabriel
How is your trust in us now?
Argo : Higher. I trust you guys a lot more. (meaning to say, given, I would be more comfortable with the deeper stuff)
Argo: How is your trust in us?
St Gab: My trust in you isn't higher. Because it was already high.
Argo trusts St Gab more.
St Gab trusts Argo more.
Yoshua trusts everyone.

Yoshua explains that he seems to have a mental block that prevents him from reaching his full potential.
Eli gains a respect for St Gabriel, for his knowledge in health. Her eyes look at St. Gabriel with a glint of respect.

7: The Rot Wizard
The party encounters the enigmatic Rot Wizard at his small abode, a little north of the town Ranlean. The Wizard is clad in a striking attire of black leather. His residence, nestled deep within the forest, doubles as his laboratory. Fungi flourish in abundance, encircling his abode. Upon their arrival, the party relinquishes the bodies retrieved from their wooden wagon to the wizard, who promptly instructs them to wait outside while he commences his meticulous autopsy. Cautionary whispers circulate among the group, mindful of potential contagions within the wizard's dwelling.

As the hours wear on, boredom slowly infiltrates the party's ranks. Eli, consumed by curiosity, seizes the opportunity to explore further. Through the chimney she ventures, wielding live fire, her intentions fixed on observing the progress of the rot wizard's work. In a desperate bid to safeguard herself from the flames, she involuntarily loses control of her bladder. Simultaneously, driven by her opportunistic nature, she discreetly pockets a few items while navigating the premises.

Meanwhile, the Rot Wizard emerges from his sanctuary, delivering the unsettling news that the affliction at hand might be none other than the dreaded spell plague. Assuring the party that he will imminently journey to the church armed with a rudimentary antidote.

After having survived an orc attack, the team find themselves in company of Kai, the Warlock Wizard who had been told by the Rot Wizard to leave the premise, and the lone human among the orcs. This lone human displayed amazing combat prowess, hiding almost in plain sight.

Having traveled a few days East, the group review their motives and direction of travel.

They let Squish free, and he proves his trustworthiness by aiding the group when direwolves attack.

A direwolf gets scared off by Yoshua’s command.

Kai gets severely hurt by a Direwolf’s bite. Macy the horse is blown back by Kai’s thunderwave, severely injuring the horse and blowing a hoove off. She now has 3 legs.

The wolves are slain, notably when Eli leaves a dagger in the shoulder blade of one wolf. Argo frontflip kicks it into the wolf’s heart.



Only one wolf survives, running into a camp of muscle bound persons. The camp piles onto the wolf, capturing it. 

As Yoshua goes to speak to the group about the wolf, one sees Yoshua and asks “...Is that you, Yoshua?”

9: The Camp

Lore Development

DnD Session 15
Yoshua and Saint find themselves in a desert town. They recently just got back together and are doing a small tour as a mercenary pair as celebration for meeting back up. Yoshua was recently abandoned by his tribe. Saint has some magical ability, but is not yet fully realized.

They ride a wagon to what they thought would be their hometown. Regnor Perdu. An academia town.

To the Sands of Sornes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1 for Yoshua and Saint: What did you immediately go to?
Q2 Ramssess

Q3 Nezra
You've been promoted to agent, tasked to ascertain if an Outreach Outpost is suitable. An outpost being a small shack that supports 3 agents to help develop the town, spread the word about the organization, then reassigning agents. They want to know how long they should have an outpost in Sornes for, before the township and the organization can make a fair agreement for resources.

They wake up after a bar brawl, incited by Yoshua. They are bruised and battered.

A figure steps over them.

Nezra.
It's been months since Nezra had seen Yoshua. With Nezra, Ramssess. Who had informed Nezra that he is on a quest to return to his group, a clan of elven desert striders.

Nezra has been assigned to be a sole agent for the Former Cobalt Soul. (A name change is in the works.) She just so happened to come upon Ramssess as he looked lost in the town square (as lost as she did). She was tasked to do recon, see if there is any value for Former Cobalt Soul Outreach Program to set up base here. She's been due to return 2 weeks ago.

They meet up and talk at a safer place. (Bar)


Quest:
Yoshua Saint: Get back to Regnor Perdu. or find money to get a ride to Regnor.
Nezra: Help Ramssess find his group
Ramssess: Find his group

The town doesn't get too many travelers, or wagons. The next one is due a month from now.

The ones who fought Yoshua and Saint are the nicer orc raiders. (If they remember this)

A cloaked figure (Leopold the Farmer) comes up to the group. It looks to be a halfling. He asks the group to clear out whatever's been killing his buffalo. (It's a giant were-falcon)


Leopold is a Orc, who is incredibly handsome. He used to live with the raiders but was constantly harassed for his looks.

In return, the farmer will take them to where they need to go, and half of all the gold he has.

1: Find Clues
Barn, Plains, Buffalo Remains

2: Dinner with the Farmer
He's curious about his hires. Curious about the Elven Striders, the Cobalt Soul, and Yoshua and Saint's relationship.
3: Attack during dinner (Pitch Black)
3: Investigate (Cave or Oasis, as mentioned by the Farmer)
Cave has glowing stactites, and a pool of water that grants 1+ Strength. Oasis has rare materials that are worth a good amount of silver.
4: Discovery
The second place will have the source, a giant pile of feathers. Inside a toddler giant sleeping.

How to handle this?

Upon return, the farmer is working hard, his bandages soaked in sweat.

Hearing the news, he pulls open a closet, and reveals a wall with countless tusked skeletons. He fishes out some gold and gives them to the party.

Riding the wagon, the group have a moment to talk to each other.

Past Episodes and Notes

6: Old Witch’s Ruins
Rats
Group hears the witch’s howl. Eyes pop out from the darkness. One pair. Two. 4. Eight. 16.
They become enveloped in rats.

Run to bridge

They fall down, into the basement of the castle ruins.

The Dark
Place description
The party falls, partially cushioned by the sheer volume of the rats that fall with them. The hard floor is damp and cold. It smells of mildew and a hint of animal droppings. The air is filled with the clacking of rat claws. A lone bat screeches out and flaps away.

 Some or the rats scatter; some stay and stalk the group as they recollect themselves. 

Text to friends:

Argo
I’ve been travelling with Eli since she saved me at that bar robbery. The city streets that I survived off had nothing for either of us. We left together. Find a way to end these nightmares.

A ghost came to the group. Burned woman, burning in a ghastly green. 
“Baseplate, Bezel, Arrow, Needle. Baseplate, Bezel, Arrow, Needle. Soak the cork, destroy the evil.” What does that mean?

She pointed East. Guess that’s where I’m headed to. That’s where the group is going.

Eli
Saved this gnome during a bar robbery. Had a few drinks with him. Decent guy. Started travelling together. He helps with the jobs I take to earn money. Still looking for ‘him’. My mentor. I still think of the people we hurt, all those years ago.

My patron came to me. Bina. the harlequin, for the first time. Showed me a few new spells. She mentioned my quest to find my mentor, showing disapproval. But that I am my own woman. She will not stop me.

She says her dance lacks vigor. Inspiration. She wants me to play matchmaker, help others fall in love. In return, more spells.

Yoshua
Left my town to get swollen huge. Joined a barbarian clan. They kicked me out because I didn't do leg day or cardio.’ assholes. Found Gabriel, my guy. Dependable. Gonna tag along with him, get more swole along the way.

This is my path to gains.

Saint
I was trained by Archfather Raphael to do good for the people around me. He sent me to Priest Padre, and I accepted to go on a pilgrimage. The first stop was Ranlean, to do what I can about the plague.

In Ranlean I met Chorbishop Cali. She said I am not ordained. Why didn’t Archfather Raphael ordain me?

On the way to the Rot Wizard to deliver this body for examination, We stopped at an unexplored ruins. Inside was a library. We found a monster that resembled a toad woman. She attacked us.
 
I casted magic after being potentially exposed. Now I have a tightness in my chest. We’ve fallen down deeper into the ruins.

Deliver the body to the Rot Wizard. 
Return to Ranlean to be properly ordained.
Continue on my pilgrimage to do good.






Steel Paladin. A Jaded man with a single terrible scar on his back. He is excitable to self improvement, but only this. With everything else, he is numb and passive.

Auntie: Is this the one you were talking about? Your hometown friend?

What to do with the wolf
Auntie to Yoshua: How’s the group you travel with?
We are travelling to a competition on the other side of the Continent. Heard of it just two weeks ago.
There’s a room here underneath this tree. Some kind of secret room? It has odd writing.

What to offer players: Small trader
Strength buffs
Dungeon quest: Halfway open. 3 rooms. Requires halfing. (first room)
Figured out the first part. (Paladins don’t want the carbs.)
Eating to enter.

Room 1 Simple Physical test. There is a pedestal with food on it. Across the room, a tightrope that goes up a smooth wall, up 15 feet, like 50ft across. At the top, a large boulder and a door. There’s a giant stone pedestral.A pedestal keeps providing food.

 Halflings figured out that other halfings would eat then just sleep. (Can’t throw up. Gnomes teamed up with Dwarves. Physical test is easy, balance on a rope, and push a heavy boulder to a pedestal.

Room 2 Beer test. Halflings thought that if they managed to get through, there should be security to bypass. Dwarves can drink a lot. They could fix that.

Room 3. Goblin Text. Easily bypassable lock. Menacing traps aimed at the treasure box. (They don’t work, they fall apart immediately.)

Inside: Squirrel Heads
A rusty dagger
1 copper
Box of spices
Ingot of Silver
“The story of the trio” (slightly muddled by water.)
Halfing: We met a goblin baby. This one is free of sin. Dwarf wanted to kill it.

Dwarf: Blasted Halfie. Kept the monster. I’ll find my chance to kill it.

Halfling: It’s grown on Him! After 3 months, he’s seen the light.

Dwarf: It’s not so bad. It fetches me tools. Blasted thing’s thinkin’ I’m its mother. Can’t kill it now.

Halfing: We got married. The feast was amazing.

Dwarf: Me lad’s gotten sick. Travelled far and wide for medicine. I know nothing of herbs. Gotta get a healer.

Halfing: Gerard’s gotten real sick. Galmed’s tearing his beard out trying to find a cure. Our baby may not make it.

Dwarf: Here lies Gerard Greenfoot. In our short time together, he’s changed the way I see goblins. The boy’s favorite things. The squirrel trophies he caught himself. Broke a tooth catching them. Forged him a knife. The spices Carrie was gonna use for his upcoming birthday.

Was gonna take him to a Dwarven fest. Dress him up, throw me cap on him. Damn gobby could’ve fit entirely in it. The copper I was gonna pay to get him in. Was gonna make a prime dagger for im to catch all the furries when he got better.

I was too harsh on the lad. I know that. Carr carr saw that. If onl --__---

Questions

A couple are running through the woods, chased by something. It could be a village, it could be some sort of evil, a hungry beast. In the father’s arms, a bundle. He gets wounded, dropping it. In the bundle, a baby girl, with long, thick purple locks and pointy ears.

What was chasing them?
Enemies (Forgot if People or big Animal)

Did the couple return?
No


The girl is older now, can walk and talk. She is in the forest. Growing up, she notices that the paths she frequents grow with more flora and fauna than those she occasionally takes. It is only when she does this one thing that she realizes she can manipulate the natural world. 

What did she do?
Meditate, Stick to herself

The woman is much older now and much wiser. She’s found others like her, but they come and go.

They did not prepare her for the creature that she saw in the woods. A forest creature she found graceful, powerful, intelligent and kind.

What was the creature?
Leopardlike (Gave Jaimee the skillsheet)

Argo \  Eli \ St. Gabriel \ Yoshua
Yoshua 1: Mako

Yoshua walks along a riverbank up stream, feeling lost. without purpose. As he walks, the sands become red. More and more blood appears. You see a single green finger float down the river. Then a leg.

At the cliff face, There’s like 12 bodies ripped to shreds, dragged, torn and half-eaten. Lying dead, 2 giant shark like creatures with four legs and fur. Their armor broken, their leather straps cut. A metal plate on the side of both creatures is etched in orcish “Mako 1; Biter 3”. One of them has a swollen underbelly. It’s twitching. You watch as two shark offspring bite their way out. They’re tired, and make no noise. Their legs waggle in the air.

Over the top of the cliff, two figures in shining armor point to Yoshua. Yoshua watches as 2, 5, 8, 10 soldiers start to look for a way down. A giant in haphazard cast iron armor splits the trees, peers down.

What do?

Saint 1: Inordained
Visiting the Church
Understanding the Plague
The plague seems to only affect spellcasters at the time of casting. Those of the church and of the universities and colleges are getting sick.
The priest takes the 5 masks, keeps one, gives the rest to his assistant.
“St. Gabriel. A saint. A do-gooder. Hmm. Come to the Shrine.”
St. Gabriel prays.
Chorbishop Arel : “What are you doing? You just knelt down. This is a blessed altar. Channel your divinity.
You weren’t…
You weren’t ordained.
She racks his brain, Arel rushes to the altar. She begins to pray. As she does, sunshine floods the room more. 2 glowing wings on both side glow.
What did Rafael tell you exactly? You’re from his church, yes? You can cast magic? So then why...

See the Rot Wizard, in the grasslands. He’ll know what to do.
He leads the group outside, to a wagon. In the wagon, 2 dead bodies.
“Take these to him for examination.in the Grasslands.”

When you get back, I’ll ordain you myself what in the… What is the Archfather thinking?

Wolves appear. They are organized. A giant wolf appears. It spits out a bunny, which commands the pack. It asks for a griffin egg.

"Ah, one of my kind."

"Tell me young one, from one noble to another..."

"Do you know where I can find... The winged lions?"

"Hmmm."

Biliran: Scorched Earth

19JA1: Scorched Earth (October 9 2022)
Billiran (Billy-Ran) is sent to find his cousin, who is in Strixhaven. He goes from his city Amethyst Peak to the portal with a knight and his squire.

Mending the Royal Tapestries’s loose threads (Session J1: Scorched Earth)
Billiran is outside the castle gates. He’s been walking around, surveying the area.

A knight and his halfling squire are at the gate waiting for him. The knight has a hand made of obsidian stone. The hand is resting on the handle of his sword, on his hip. Billiran does not know who he is. The knight tells him that his grandfather, the King, is waiting for him. Biliran ponders who this knight is, but continues on.


Biliran is barefoot, his footsteps sizzling into the carpet. “I am no longer king. It belongs to my son, who is gone now. His daughter is away.”



“I need you to find Lancia. Your cousin. She will ascend to the throne.”
“Her? Why not my father?”
“It is the way of our people. The eldest child belongs to the throne. And if not them, then their child.”

“Grandfather, I believe I am worthy of the throne. I will discuss this when I get back.”

“Of course. Go, find your cousin. Go to the portal that leads to the strixhaven academy.”

Billiran talks to his father. The father has royal clothes on, but the heat is burning.
“Boy.”
“Father. First time to this academy. Any advice?”
“I’ve never gone there. Lancia is the first to go. My brother wished this. I have prepared a guide to find the portal.”
Belial whistles.
“This is Sir Luka Celestine. His Squire, Arthur Aiden.”
King: “My little friend!”

Private talk with Father
“This is a chance for the throne. Kill the Knights. Kill Your cousin.

Biliran punches his father on the arm. His knuckles are now burned. singed.


Biliran talks to the knight and the squire. He threatens Arthur, with a booming voice tells him to not order him around.
The Plan: cross through the sulfur caverns. Reach Pele’s playground. Enter the portal.

Arthur squeaks at the heat of the caverns.

Luka raises the sword horizontally with one hand. The sword is made of glass.. He’s looking through it.

Biliran: “What are you doing?”

Luka: The Dragon Knights have earned enchanted weapons from the kingdom. This is made of dragonglass. It detects magic.”

The sword is greenish/bluish.
The way is dark. There are so many different routes that without the knight, anyone would have gotten lost. Biliran’s view is darting around.
Arthur is quiet, but one can visibly see that he’s being affected by the heat.
Luka” This has to be the way. This is the exit. I’ve been following the sword. But I don’t remember this stone figure.
The whole figure looks like a dragon head, the exit being the mouth of the dragonhead.
There is an inscription in a different language. Arthur reads it to Luka “Puff Puff”.
Biliran asks “Isn’t sulfur flammable?”


Biliran climbs up and sets alit the dragon’s nostrils. Along the way, he knocks a boulder down, attempting to hurt the knight and squire. He misses. The exit begins to light up. The noise and vibrations wake up the sulfur bats.

Battle.
Luka’s sword glows green.
Biliran smashes a bat into paste on the floor.
Arthur summons a spiritual weapon; another sword.
“Ill make quick work of these bats!” Biliran misses.
Arthur’s spiritual weapon keeps failing to summon.
Arthur summons a shield of faith to protect Luka.
Arthur summons spiritual weapon rods. They’re blue and see-through.
Biliran smashes and launches a bat to the ceiling. 

They exit the caverns.

Pele’s Playground.


A bunch of lava pools. Open sky.
Arthur summons a gray falcon familiar. It’s name is Millenia.
Biliran tries to knock Arthur into the lava pools.
The group finds a small lake filled with white light.
Biliran chucks a rock into the white lake.
Luka says to Biliran “Let’s return to the King.”
“You may not know who Biliran is. But he does not hold back. You need to come with me, or I go alone.”
While looking at them, he begins to walk backwards into the pool.
They both stop him. Arthur loses his footing. He’s thrown into the pool. Luka pulls Biliran out of the pool.
“What are you doing, why are you not following orders? You’re not even in line for the throne!”
Luka takes out his glass sword and points it at Biliran.
“As expected from the sun of the Hellflame.”
Biliran walks calmly a few feet away from Luka, his back to the Knight.
“You dare raise your sword to the son of the Hellflame? Me? Biliran? You would do best to sheath your sword. Knight.”
“Who am I? I’m one of the few greatest knights of Amethyst Peak. I’ve fought many to get to where I am now. I know who you are. You’re the son of the Hellflame. He’s never contributed anything as the king. It’s obvious he’s only there for himself. Why does King Filo continue to keep your father at his hand?.”

“Like father, like son. You’re going to be exactly like him.”

Luka brings out his sword.
Biliran is cut across the chest. Lines of lava spill out. His lava veins begin to expand throughout his body.

“YOU DARE!? WITH THE SON OF THE HELLFLAME!? I WILL BE SURE TO BRING BACK YOUR HEAD TO MY FAMILY, ASSASSIN.”



Luka adopts a fencing stance.
Biliran destroys Luka’s obsidian hand.
Luka: “I wish you were on our side.”

Biliran smashes Luka multiple times with his warhammer. Lava is pouring out of him, Even biliran’s slobbery spit is lava.

Luka is down. “I hate you.” He falls into a pool of lava.
Biliran screams out into the sky. His lava veins begin to cool. He falls to the floor exhausted. Luka’s dragonglass sword is close to Biliran.

Biliran picks it up. It’s changed. It’s now red. Looking throught it, Biliran sees an ethereal trail of which they previously followed. Biliran sees that the trail leads back to the castle.

Biliran examines his options. Return to the castle and report the assassin, or go through the portal.
Biliran cuts his waterskin into a sack and puts Luka’s smashed hand in it.
Biliran looks into the pool, pondering the adventure he may have through it. He sees students in uniforms.
“This must be Strixhaven.”
Biliran sees a female student with red hair. “It’s you. It’s Lancia.”
Biliran takes one last look around. He looks at the pool that Luka fell into, then hops into the pool, chasing after Lancia.

…
Arthur’s gray falcon, Millenia, is still around. It saw everything that transpired. It flies out from Pele’s playground, uncovered by the lava cavern ceiling. The falcon communicates with Belial. It magically relays what happened. King Filo’s mysterious secondhand man converses with Belial.
“What did he do?”
Belial: ”...Scorched Earth.”

Kazka ChatGPT
The night was thick with darkness as Kazka sat slumped at the bar, drowning his sorrows in a sea of ale. Born in Aralon, the son of a former adventurer, he had inherited a legacy of daring and danger. But it was a pact with a mysterious being, introduced to him by his father, that had brought misfortune and misery to Kazka's life. The pain inflicted upon him and those around him was crippling, a constant reminder of the pact's malevolent power.

Desperate for salvation, Kazka turned to Petrichor, the deity of Aralon, and fervently prayed for guidance. In his unwavering devotion, he became a Paladin, dedicating himself to serving Petrichor's righteous cause. Seeking a way out of Aralon, he decided to join the adventurer's guild, hoping to find purpose and redemption beyond the borders of his troubled homeland.

But as he approached the guild, he caught a glimpse into the minds of the first group he encountered. They saw Kazka as nothing more than cannon fodder, a disposable human shield to be thrown into the fray. Disheartened but undeterred, he sought out another group, one comprised of inexperienced adventurers with menial tasks ahead of them—clearing out rats in the sewers, collecting flowers, and the like.

Joining the Adventurer's Guild as a young man, Kazka met Grum, Jerry, and Fumir, forming a bond that would reshape their lives. Together, they embarked on countless quests and perilous adventures, their deeds spreading far and wide. The four became renowned throughout the land, their exploits earning them the moniker "The Band."

But the tale of The Band was not one of unending triumph. Tragedy befell them one by one, shattering their unity and testing Kazka's spirit. Jerry met his demise in a cataclysmic explosion, collapsing a cave filled with monsters. Grum, facing bitter cold and encased in fallen ice, succumbed to death's icy grip. Fumir, the last remaining companion, left Kazka without a word, disappearing into the night, leaving behind a void of unanswered questions.

Lost and broken, Kazka turned to the solace of spirits, drowning his sorrows in the darkest corners of the taverns that dotted the towns he passed through. For years, he wandered aimlessly, a ghost of his former self, his pain etched deeply into every line of his weathered face. By the time the Einkhala Mission presented itself, he was 38 years old, wearied by the weight of his own existence.

It was in the desert village of Sornes, as the moon cast a pale glow over the sandy landscape, that Kazka found himself in a dimly lit bar, drowning his memories. That night, fate would intervene in the form of Cerwind, a young Owlin Ranger, and a small human child named Terry. Roused from his stupor, Kazka was compelled to listen as they explained their desperate need for him to retrieve the Einkhala—an artifact last mentioned during the heyday of The Band. They were members of Palladium, an enigmatic group of researchers, and the tusks of the Einkhala held crucial significance for their magical studies.

Reluctantly, Kazka accepted their proposition, his weary heart yearning for any glimmer of hope. In return for the Einkhala's tusks, Palladium promised to provide him with information about Fumir, the one person he longed to meet again. And so, under the cloak of night, they embarked on a treacherous seven-day journey northeast, towards Straphan Forest.

With the moon casting a dim glow over the landscape, Kazka and his newfound companions, Cerwind and the young scholar Terry, stood at a crucial crossroads. Before them lay two paths: the long, safe route, and the shorter, treacherous cliffside ascent. The urgency of their mission propelled them to make a daring choice—the cliff was their path to take.

Heart pounding, muscles straining, Kazka led the way, scaling the near-vertical cliff with sheer determination. Every foothold and handhold counted, as they defied gravity and embraced the thrill of risk. As they ascended, the winds whispered secrets of ancient perils and unseen dangers that awaited them on their journey.

Days turned to nights and back again as they ventured forth, their footsteps guided by the slivers of shade offered by the scorching sun. But danger was never far behind. Suddenly, their path was beset by two colossal creatures—giant lizards lunging at them with jaws agape. The group fought valiantly, their blades clashing with reptilian scales. However, their victory was swiftly replaced by perplexity as they realized the lizards were nothing more than cunningly crafted mechanical constructs, mere facades concealing a more sinister force at play.

The revelation of their adversaries being robotic sent shivers down their spines. The true danger lurking in their path became palpable, instilling a sense of urgency within their ranks. Two days later, as they rested and conversed, Cerwind shared his dreams of becoming a renowned adventurer, walking in the footsteps of the legendary Kazka himself. Terry, driven by his scholarly pursuits, spoke passionately of his research for Palladium, delving into the mysteries of the magical arts.

Their peaceful conversation was abruptly shattered as the robotic lizards reemerged, attacking with a vengeance. In the chaos that ensued, Terry found himself trapped in his tent, unable to escape the relentless assault. Helplessly, Kazka and Cerwind fought to protect their fallen comrade, but it was too late. Terry succumbed to the venomous bites of the mechanical monstrosities.

Grief-stricken yet resolute, Cerwind vowed to honor Terry's memory. He wrapped the fallen scholar's body in a makeshift shroud of tent cloth, carrying the weight of a promise made to deliver Terry back to his people. With each step, their resolve to complete their mission burned brighter, fueled by a mixture of vengeance and the determination to see their task through to the end.

Two days passed, and the journey led them to the fabled Ancient Ruins—an enigmatic testament to forgotten civilizations and untold secrets. They navigated treacherous fire traps and cunning arrow mechanisms, their every move dictated by the wisdom of survival. Climbing higher, they reached the apex of an ancient tower, where a legendary gem awaited them. Three blades, each adorned with a gem of radiant power, shimmered in the dim light. Instinct guided Kazka's hand as he reached for the green gem, a choice that seemed to resonate with his very soul.

Having acquired the gem, they wasted no time lingering in the ruins. Their quest was far from over, and the Straphan Forest beckoned them, promising both answers and challenges on their path. With determination etched upon their faces, they embarked once more into the unknown, hearts resolute as they continued their arduous journey.

Four days later, their travels amounted to fifteen days of unyielding determination and swift footsteps. The path they had chosen, fraught with peril and loss, had brought them this far.

Emerging from the depths of their arduous journey, Kazka, Cerwind, and their burdened souls arrived at the majestic Straphan Forest. As they stepped into the verdant expanse, their senses heightened, and they were greeted by a captivating sight. In the distance, a pack of red wolves, their coats blazing like the setting sun, moved with fluid grace, led by a magnificent white wolf—a beacon of untamed power.

Aware of the time-sensitive nature of their mission, they set up camp and patiently awaited the arrival of the Einkhala. The passing days weighed heavily upon them, amplified by the stench of decay emanating from Terry's rotting body, a grim reminder of their fallen comrade's fate.

During their wait, Cerwind unveiled his trump card—a quiver of Tranquilizer Arrows. Crafted with precision, only three of these arrows needed to find their mark to bring down the elusive Einkhala. The camp nestled beneath a majestic waterfall, its cascading melodies drowning out the symphony of doubt and anticipation that echoed within their hearts.

Then, in a sudden burst of anticipation, the Einkhala revealed itself, its presence like a whisper carried by the wind. Swift and elusive, it defied their expectations, challenging their resolve. In that crucial moment, Kazka tapped into the wellspring of his divine connection, summoning a mystical steed—a horse imbued with black tentacles that swirled around its powerful form.

Mounted upon his otherworldly steed, Kazka and Cerwind pursued the Einkhala with an unwavering determination. The chase unfolded amidst a chaotic ballet of arrows and fangs, as Cerwind unleashed his tranquilizer-laden arsenal upon both the swift Einkhala and the relentless wolves that trailed its wake.

At breakneck speed, Kazka guided the horse, its hooves thundering against the forest floor, deftly maneuvering through the dense foliage. They weaved between towering trees, narrowly avoiding catastrophic collisions, as their moving battle raged on. Arrows whistled through the air, piercing the flesh of both prey and predator.

And then, as destiny aligned with their desperate endeavor, the third tranquilizer arrow struck true. The Einkhala, its strength waning, slowed its frenzied sprint and careened into the riverbank, its once unyielding spirit now subdued. It was a moment of triumph amidst chaos.

With the green blade gripped firmly in his hand, Kazka approached the subdued Einkhala. The air crackled with anticipation as the blade, infused with the power of Petrichor, sizzled through the air, severing the tusks from the fallen beast. A surge of accomplishment washed over them—a tangible symbol of their perseverance and sacrifice.

As the adrenaline of their recent victory subsided, Kazka found himself faced with an unexpected encounter. A baby Einkhala, small and vulnerable, emerged from the shadows, attempting to defend its fallen mother. Its clumsy attempts at aggression melted away any lingering hostility within Kazka's heart. He realized that this young creature mourned the loss of its perceived protector.

Moved by compassion, Kazka gently disarmed the baby Einkhala, understanding its misguided intentions. With a heavy heart, he watched as the baby Einkhala wailed in sorrow, its world forever changed. Determined to honor its fallen mother's memory, Kazka and Cerwind gathered their belongings, leaving the forest behind as they embarked on a new chapter of their journey.

Their path led them to the vibrant city of Ranlean, where Cerwind and Terry had originated. Seeking answers and closure, they made their way to Palladium, the organization for which Terry had been collecting the Einkhala tusks. There, they were granted an audience with Lysra, a decorated member of Palladium.

As Lysra's eyes fell upon the Green Blade and the prized tusks, her approving gaze conveyed an unspoken acknowledgement of their achievements. However, the sight of Terry's lifeless body dampened the moment. Disappointment clouded Lysra's expression as she revealed that it was Terry whom she had dispatched on this mission. It was Terry who had hired Cerwind, and subsequently, they had sought the aid of Kazka.

Glimmers of regret flickered in Kazka's eyes as the weight of responsibility settled upon him. However, Lysra's tone shifted, recognizing Kazka as a former hero of renown. She extended a small bag brimming with coins and jewels, a gesture of gratitude for their success in obtaining the Einkhala tusks. Alongside the treasure, she presented a map—etched with intricate details—a map that would lead Kazka to a Tiefling Settlement, the place where Fumir could be found.

With newfound purpose in his stride, Kazka bid Cerwind farewell. Their hands clasped in a gesture of understanding and support, Cerwind headed to address the sorrowful chapter that Terry's death had brought upon them. Meanwhile, Kazka set his sights on the path ahead, fueled by the knowledge that the opportunity to reunite with Fumir awaited him.

Armed with a map, a bag of provisions, and a mixture of determination and trepidation, Kazka ventured forth, his previous and future business intertwining within his thoughts. The knowledge that he could once again cross paths with Fumir, the enigmatic figure from his past, fueled his resolve.

The road stretched out before Kazka, winding and uncertain. Yet, armed with the memories of his fallen companions and the promise of a reunion, he pressed forward, ready to face the trials and revelations that lay ahead.


Veilo: The Mercenary
Session Date July 9, Midnight 2023



Up in the Northern Mountains of Caerne, a lone soldier in the heat of the autumn sun is walking up mountainous terrain. All around him are purple stones, made glossy and smooth from the many volcanoes that spot the landscape.

The man is adorned in beige armor, the handles of his flail and shield are warm from the emerging sun. Sweat beads and falls from his brow, crossing down from his tan olive skin, and into his thick beard. Sweat permeates into his green clothes, coloring his armpits a darker shade. This hike is uncomfortable. His thought is in regret, as he should have bought a donkey to carry his battle gear for him. He was warned by the merchants that the castle would be far.

But that mistake was understandable. This is the first time he’s been out this far North. He was not sure that a donkey could manage the trip. And he did not have the energy to care for a creature, especially in unfamiliar regions.

The morning dew had dispersed. With the moisture from the air gone, so too did the clouds and the fog, revealing the sparse trees in this area. The northern mountains of the Caerne continent are to be feared; many manners of beasts much larger and stronger than the common man live here, with a hostile demeanor to match the unforgiving mountainscape. Minimal vegetation calls for a land of carnivores. Care is to be paid here. Suddenly the man is thankful for not buying a donkey. The beast of burden would surely die, eaten alive the moment Veilo turned his back. Maybe by those winged creatures the townsfolk were gossiping about.

The man takes a break, stretching out on a large boulder along the path. Hours had passed since he left the last settlement. Veilo reaches into a shirt pocket, producing a brass pocket watch. 4 hours since he left. He’s not far from the end of the trail.

He pressed the watch’s adjustment knob. The pocket watch flicks open. Inside it, a photo of a family. Veilo sees himself next to a woman whose eyes look just like his. Next to her, another man. And below them, 5 nieces and nephews.

His sister wasn’t the nicest person, as their friends would say. Veilo disagrees. She was straightforward. No nonsense. Sure she wasn’t nice, but she was kind. And that’s all that really matters at the end of the day.

Maybe her kindness was why she was called back to the here-after, much earlier than planned. She leaves behind five children. 5 children that look too much like her. A flicker of grief flashes in Veilo’s chest.

Veilo closes the watch and resumes the hike. The sun is directly overhead. The fog is gone completely. He can now see the silhouette of a castle. This must be the place.

…

Veilo stands in front of a fellow human. A fellow soldier, judging from the sword handle poking out over his shoulder. His eyes are sunken in. He leans against the castle’s 15 feet tall portcullis entry. 

The size of the portcullis is awkward and unnecessary. It’s taller than normal. Taller than any other castle gate that Veilo has seen. It is a waste of resources to have it built so tall. It meant additional thicker bricks to support its size. Longer staircases to the wall’s walkway. With the soldier leaning against it as he does, He looks like an ant. And so do the sentries that peek over the wall’s embrasures.

 Is this the place that requested him?

Veilo
“Hello, Friend. Where are we?”

Upon closer inspection, Veilo can sense that this man is a seasoned fighter. A veteran. It’s in the way he moves. The way he stands relaxed, yet alert to his surroundings. War recognizes war. And Veilo feels it from the man across from him. He’s not just a fellow soldier. He’s a fellow veteran. Surely a knight.

The knight looks Veilo up and down.

Knight
“... You must be who the crown sent for. We don’t get too many visitors, you see. Ours is a new kingdom. The trail here is far too dangerous for a random passerby.”

He knocks on the Portcullis. A soldier with a sun visor looks down from an unfinished castle turret, then disappears from sight. The portcullis slowly raises.

Knight
“Welcome to the Breitling Kingdom. The King has been expecting you, Veilo. Come.”

Veilo follows.
The ceiling of the structure, like the portcullis, is much higher than necessary. A recurring theme of this new rulership. Why? Was the king a fan of extravagant architecture? As a result, Veilo feels.. Smaller. Likely a design to make the king appear larger in the mind’s eye.

They two walk through a long corridor. The occasional worker or worker pair passes Veilo and the knight as they make their way to the castle ruler. Past the workers, the castle feels unprocessed. Walls half done, windows unfinished, etc. As if the castle was an afterthought to some kind of mining operation.

Sir Luka (Knight)
“I am Sir Luka, Veilo. And thank you for coming. We received your reply a few days ago and have prepared what is needed for your arrival. The crown and court will be pleased to have you.”

Veilo
“Such extravagance, friend! This castle is… unique. The first I've seen with such high walls.”

Sir Luka
“Yes, well…
…
The King’s right hand man has told me about you. An accomplished individual with history in the field of battle. You’ve won your fair share of blood. And I suppose you’ve not seen defeat, yes? Not missing any parts, No scars to be seen. Worn armor with the occasional scratch here and there. Gashes and dents. You’re no deserter, The armor rests on your body in proper proportion. It was made for you. Not taken from a soldier slain.

Ah- forgive me. I meant not to insinuate. A new kingdom has its share of false courtmen. I’ve gotten used to their nuances. My spirit has grown weary of them and my lips and gotten loose.”

He stops, turns to Veilo and bows his head low.

Sir Luka
“I apologize, guest of the court.”

Veilo
“Oh, friend, it is quite alright. In fact, I am pleased to hear this. This is a strength that can also be used in battle. The strength of intelligence. A weapon that is held with the tongue.

I’ve spoken to many adventurers about this kingdom, and I am elated to hear about your virtues. It is rare to hear of a king that requires his court and men to be educated like the scholars of the south.

It is true, yes? Everyone here can read?”

Sir Luka raises his head, a smirk on his lips.

Sir Luka
“That is true, yes.”

He continues to lead the way. Sir Luka remains silent.

They turn a corner and walk past a set of large wooden doors, crossing into the throne room. Their entrance is immediately met by the gaze of a man who sits on the throne, his hand grasping tightly onto the handle of a claymore.

 A man in noble silk garments from the corner of the throne room sees the two enter. He stands and cries out.

Crier
“Presenting Sir Luka and Veilo! Welcome! King Breitling receives you!”

Sir Luka leans to say something to Veilo.

Sir Luka
“Veilo; You are in the presence of King Breitling. The man who sees you fit for action, at another’s suggestion.”


From afar the king looked like a large individual. Until Veilo and Sir Luke come closer. It is only when Veilo comes closer that he discovers why the gates were built so large. King Breitling is a Giant.

King Breitling sits upon his throne, his size reminiscent of an homage statue fit for the gods. His shoulders are adorned with a silk purple cloak, with white fur trim. His hair is short, about a pinch long from the scalp. No beard adorns his face. 

Left of the throne, the throne’s right hand, is a human man. A rapier hangs from his waist. He nods to Sir Luka.

In the king’s left hand, the pommel of a Claymore sword, the blade resting against the throne armrest. The sword is made of transparent crystal, the weapon’s core something like green glass. It exudes a faint green light, no doubt of magical origin. It looks to be just as long as Veilo is tall, something like 6 feet. This is the first time Veilo has seen such a weapon. 

As Veilo walks closer to the king, his neutral expression does not change. His gaze travels up and down Veilo’s armor and shield.

He stands.

The size of the Portcullis was not to display the scale of the king’s wealth, but of the king himself. King Breitling stands as tall as 12 feet.
His presence alone is enough to have Veilo bend the knee. Sir Luka joins.

Veilo:
“King Breitling, sir. 
My King.”

A moment of silence passes.

King Breitling
“Rise, Soldier.”

Veilo stands.

Breitling begins to walk about, his claymore in hand, acting as his version of a scepter. With each step, the castle floor shakes slightly.

King Breitling
“I’ve heard of you, Veilo. You’ve done well for yourself. My right hand tells me this.
The Battle of the Horizon, do you remember? Your performance was exemplary.”

“...I bring you here to address an issue. The issue of war. Something here that we are all too familiar with.”

His gaze travels to Luka. He nods. Breitling turns to the man next to the throne. With a smile, he nods and pats his rapier twice.

King Breitling
“The Black Bay Kingdom. Ruled by Deville. You know of them, yes? We have traded blows before. A familiar rival to the wealth that these mountains offer.

They once said to us that 'If I, ‘King Breitling, ruled the sky, then Black Bay would rule land and sea.’

I thought these words to be empty threats. They’ve added weight to those words. The weight of hundreds of men, trained to the sail and sword. To knots and armor. To travel the seas and gain ground steadfast.

This is a burden too heavy for me.I cannot fight them alone. I am far too small a man…

…But you know this already, do you not?”

Veilo
“...”


“I am assembling an elite force. One with the strength that these mountains have never seen before. And among this force, a need for someone with valor. Strength of character. Smart enough to study who they fight for. Efficient enough to keep their blade from unneeded slaughter.

This someone is here. In front of me.”

The King stops. He holds out his claymore poised, as if ready to knight someone.

King Breitling
“I need you, Soldier Veilo.

Will you join me?”

Veilo
“I will, my king.”

King Brietling nods.

King Breitling
“Nothing more. Nothing less.”

…









???
“...up…’’

???
“...ake.. up…”

???
“WAKE UP, VEILO!”

Veilo snaps awake, bloodshot eyes scan the surroundings. The sound of flames flickering echo off the castle walls. The cries of men in battle, their swords clashing and singing in the dance of life or death. Wings flapping throughout the sky and dragons fly overhead.

Veilo’s vision is blurred.  His body is sore, but more so his weapon arm. His familiar flail is nowhere to be found. There is a weight over his eyes. He cannot make out the man who kneels over him.

Veilo
“Wh- Who are you, Habibi? Where am I? What happened?”

???
“It is I, Teofilo. Do you not remember?”
Veilo remembers. Teofilo. The king’s right hand. He was there when he first met the king. The man with the rapier, leaning against the wall.

Teofilo
“It was I that requested for you. Have you forgotten? I had heard stories of you and thought you worthy addition to our cause.”


Veilo
“Yes, I… what happened here?. Why is there fighting?”

Teofilo
“The King… he… he is gone.”

Veilo’s memory is coming back to him, slowly. The room is familiar. It is the throne room. His gaze moves to the throne.

…What’s left of the throne. It has been demolished. Broken parts of the head rest lie cracked on the floor. The back rest is cracked down the middle. The right armrest has broken off and has fallen on its side.

At the foot of the stone throne, large, gaping holes have been dug through the castle’s brick flooring. As if men had dug tunnels from underneath the castle and violently sprung out.

Veilo
“Gone? Our King? Gone? Do… Do you mean…?”

A silent stare from Teofilo. Veilo looks down in concentration.

Veilo
“...Show me the king’s body.”

The ground rumbles. This rumbling is not from the fighting, but from something underneath them. A creature. A large creature.

From the corner of Veilo’s eye, something like a shark fin appears to swim through the castle floor. Heading straight for Teofilo.

Veilo scrambles away. It doesn’t register in Teofilo’s mind that they’re under attack. The creatures swim through them, leaving a line of raised brick between the two kingsmen.

Before Teofilo can pull out his rapier. The beast circles back. Teofilo is caught off guard, by a sudden drop kick from Veilo. It was the best thing Veilo could come up with, as he needed his hands free to fight. It sends Teofilo 10 feet away, safe from the beast.

Teofilo
“Wha-(Drop Kicked by Veilo)”

The beast breaches, making itself visible to the pair. The beast is huge, covered in chitinous scales. Its mouth could easily swallow the kingsmen.


As it breaches, it slashes at Veilo. His shield protects him from the gash, but he is sent flying, tumbling to Teofilo’s side. Rolling to a standing position, he sees that the shield has a large gash across it. Veilo’s been cut. A large gash on his shield arm, his right arm, will no doubt scar.

But Veilo was successful in his counter attack. A similar blow was exchanged as a portion of the beast’s chitin, around the right eye, was blown off. Blood flows from the beast’s eye.

…

In the middle of battle, Teofilo reaches behind him and produces the handle of a weapon, without any sort of blade.

Teofilo
“Veilo, here. A gift, from Brietling himself. “

He tosses it to Veilo.

Veilo
“...A rod? What is this?”

Teofilo
“It is a weapon. An honorary gift that marks a new member. Into the folds of the Jagged Edge Knights.

Use it.”

Veilo
“But… how?”

Teofilo smirks.
“You know well enough, mon ami. Activate it.”

Veilo takes the rod and gives it a squeeze. From the top of the rod, a crystal mass, like an 8 sided octahedron. The mass drops, glowing faintly green. It’s a Dragon glass flail.

Teofilo brandishes his rapier, his other arm behind his back in proper rapier form.
“You are re-armed. 
Now.
Let’s end this.”

The two kingsmen face this terrible beast. Fires coming from the throne room entrance and from the collapsed ceiling illuminate their faces. They fight in the name of their King. In the name of the Breitling Kingdom.

End of Chapter 1.




(Unprocessed Notes of Jason’s Veilo Session)
Upon Man is on his way, hiking up a rough mountainous terrain.
Man is green/yellow/ beige. Wearing armor shield and flail. 6 feet tall.
He takes out a brass stopwatch.
Stopwatch opens up. Photo of his sister, brother in law, and 5 niece/nephews.
Veilo’s thoughts are on his sister and her passing.
Sister is Tsundere, mean, but always looking out for everyone.
Veilo sees glossy purplish rocks
Area is hot, warm
In front of Veilo, a castle. A large door, like 13ft tall.
There is a human man in front of the castle. A knight. He is wearing armor and has a sword on his back. No additional details (His arms look normal here)
Veilo speaks with a middle eastern accent: “Hello, friend. (Habibi) Where am I? What is this?”
(Regular American accent) Knight: Hello. I am sir Luka. We are here, in front of Breitling Castle. Come, I will take you to the king.
(Player thoughts: (Is this the job? Is my character summoned here for the job?)
Veilo and Sir Luka walk through a long corridor of the castle. The walls look to be raw, made of raw materials. As if the castle was an afterthought.
Sir Luka: “King has been waiting for you.”
Veilo and Sir Luka approach the throne room. In front of them, a giant king. Even though he is sitting down, it is evident that he is practically a giant, his left hand able to envelop Veilo’s forearm. 
A man with a rapier on his hip is standing directly to the throne’s right side. He is leaning against the wall.
King Brietling even while sitting down is obviously large. His king cloak has fur, the whole thing is colored purple. Clean cut, short , ¼ long hair, almost buzz cut. 
To his side, a claymore. It is almost as tall as Veilo. Looks to be made of crystal. Core is green glass. Faint green light. THis thing is for sure magical. Veilo has never seen it before.
Upon seeing the king, Veilo instinctively bows to him.
Veilo: “My King.”
King Breitling stands up. He is as tall as the door to the castle. The castle door was about 13ft tall. King Breitling must be 12ft tall.
King Breitling has a raspy voice: “Veilo. I’ve heard about you.”
Battle of the Horizon (?)
Black Bay Kingdom
King: “Black Bay Kingdom, ruled by Deville.”
King: “They once said to us that ‘If we (the Brietling Kingdom)rule the sky, then they rule land and sea.’”
“Nothing More. Nothing Less.”
‘WAKE UP’
Veilo snaps awake. Eyes are bloodshot.
Veilo is awoken by a man. He recognizes him as King Breitling’s right hand man.
Veilo: “Habibi, who are you? What happened?”
Man: ”It is I, Teofilo. King Brietling’s right hand man.”
Veilo’s arm is sore, tired from swinging, fighting.
The Throne is demolished. Creatures have been bursting through the floor. Open gaping holes in the castle floor. Fire can be heard, echoing through the castle walls. Swords clanging. Dragons roaring.
Veilo: “Show me the king’s body.”
Ground rumbles. Something like shark fins swim through the ground. Headed for Teofilo
Veilo drop kicks Teofilo out of the way, his arms open for a counterattack from the fin creature.
Veilo and Teofilo attack.
Veilo gets hurt. A long gash along his arm. This scars Veilo.
Shark fin creature is hit, right in the eye.
…(Mikey: I didn’t write down what happened at this point)
Rapier is given as a gift (?)
Rapier is Dragon Glass?
Jagged Edge Knights
Veilo receives a rod from Teofilo
Veilo: “A rod, habibi? What is this?”
Teofilo: “Activate it.”
Veilo uses the rod. From the rod, a metal ball forms. Then it drops from the rod, still connected by a line. It is a dragonglass mace.
Teofilo and Veilo begin combat with the shark fin creature (Mikey: known as a bulette)
End of Session
Next session: Combat.
Immediately after, began the Kazka/Raq session.

Veilo Session 2
Battle against land creature
Teofilo and Veilo fight it
Flail cracks down on its spine. Leaves a dent.
Teofilo stabs into the created weakness
Veilo sees that it’s blind.
Teofilo finishes it off with a strike from the dent weakness to the heart.
Where is the king?
‘Veilo: Last time I saw the king, he was right here… sitting on the throne…

Leave
Battle is quiet. Flames still flickering.
Sir Luka is missing a hand. He’s pulling a sword out of the same beast.
Recounts the battle outside the castle.
We had a dragon army. They were slain by the Deville. It was him. His trademark armor.
A single horizontal strike. decimation.
Our King. The Giant. On his humongous Dragon mount.
“It has been a week since I have been brought here.
I chose to help with the fighting since I thought it was for the greater good.
I will follow you, Teofilo. You are the acting king as his right hand, yes?
But I advise that you keep your pace slow. Lest you lose two important persons “(pointing to Luka’s hand.)
Teofilo: Let us go.

Kazka and Raq: The Tale of the Hero.
Session Date July 9, Midnight 2023

Following takes place on the continent of Caerne, in the City of Ranlean. It’s been a few days since the Konnor Case. A well known court case that the whole city of Ranlean knows about. Kori is the daughter of a science researcher in the Ranlean Science Facility. RSF. There was an incident that created a riot. Some people died. Kori accuses Dr Podrigo of some sort of disease.
Raq, is a 19 Orc years old half-orc woman. She is hounded by freelance scribes looking to get more information about the court case. Raq finds this annoying. Kori and her family are still grieving. Kori hasn’t left her house since the court case.
Raq handles the freelance scribes by acting extra high and noble. She is very hush hush.
“For the good of my friends and my community, I can’t say anything.”
Raq is about people deserving to be respected and treated with dignity. Protect those who cannot protect themselves. Like Kori.
Raq starts off being angry with classmates and scribes constantly asking her for case info.
Raq isn’t stoic. She’s animated with her emotions.
“I can’t say anything”. Her face was neutral and annoyed to not give off information.
The prodding continues for five days. Raq gets used to this.
The RAINE gear is stuck on Raq. The key screws have been damaged by Konnor. The school allows her to keep it on until technicians can take it off.
Raq has been enjoying the power the gear gives her. It enables her to utilize her full orcish strength.
The clubs have been pestering her, trying to get her to join so they can win the Tria Prima Intramurals. A school competition that spans through all 3 of the cities of Ranlean, Aralon, and Amethyst Peak.
Raq decides to join the Boxing club for Ranlean College.
…
Kazka is fresh from the Einkhala quest. He is in Ranlean. It’s been a few days since then.
Kazka does research about the area up North, about the wintery area.
Tria Prima, the three cities, are in the Caerne Continent.
There is another continent north of Caerne, across the North Sea. There is magic there that constantly swirls the clouds overhead. It is winter there all throughout the seasons.
The Northernmost City on the Caerne continent is ruled by a King Marcus.
…
Soccer team asks Raq to join the team. Gear is connected to arms, not legs. No go. Track asks her to Shotput. Gear can help, but she’ll also have to do cardio. Raq decides against it. A small guy, 5’2 (Raq is 6’2) sees Raq, sees the gear, feels up her muscles a little inappropriately. Raq joins the club.
Raq wins the gold medal for Ranlean for the Boxing Division Tri-City Intramurals.

Raq hears about the terms from the Freelance scribes
…
One day a group of kids are pretending to be heroes recounting an adventure. It became a serious fight.
One of the kids happens to be Raq’s Mom’s Friend’s Kid. An orc child. He asks for help.
She stops the fight. The mom is grateful, Raq has earned her favor.

“Who’s left town?” No one
“Not you, Raq we all know about and the case. You’ve been to Aralon. We get it.”
“You asked, I answered!”
Classmates age from 15 to 19, Raq is one of the older ones
“No one’s been outside ranlean. If you knew, you’d stay home. The life of an adventurer is filled with peril and death.
Student: “We only know like 10% of the world, let us live a little.”
“Raq, you’ve seen some things. Tell us about it.”
“It’s not what you see but what you feel that changes you. (Raq Speech)
Some of them look at Kori’s death

Kazka Raq Session 2

Flashback
Jerry kicks a door in
A round for us. We just did our first big boy job.
Fumir: We just did our first big boy job
Everyone gets ale separately. You’re left by yourself. Standing in a corner.
Moment to talk to someone.
Gruum: There is something I must show you, Greenskin. Take your ale.
Only at this tavern will you see this. A previous party showed me this.
1st floor. Hidden attic door. Flip a sign to the side, pull on a string. Drops the stairs up.
Leads to a landing.

Gruum
Fumir and Jerry will join us here in a bit.
You did well down there.
I never would have thought you had that power in you. It… doesn’t feel your flavor. Do you understand? Fumir’s power, it feels like her. With your eyes closed, you know its her spell. But with you… It feels like someone else’s. 

Why is that?

I know we said we’d have you for just one job. But we can’t afford NOT to have you with us. Long term.
Behind Gruum, you can see Jerry and Fumir poking their heads out from the attic door.

We want you to join Jerry’s Jackasses.

You don’t like the name? Well. Only members of our group can change it. It used to be Fumir’s Outfit before Jerry. And before that it was… just Gruum. It’s a rite in the group.

So. What’s the new name of our group?

…
He said yes, guys

Jerry and Fumir rush him with hugs. Fumi makes magical crowd-like noises.

Fumir’s hug
“I was afraid that you would say no. It’s… nice. to have a fellow tiefling around.

Jerry “Ay, there's some guy with a doohickey who just got here. He’s making like, instant paintings. But without magic. It’s wild, you gotta come check it out.

Fumir “Let’s all get a group painting. To commemorate”
Gruum Why not? Lets all take one with the Greenskin.”

Photos taken. A whole pile. Props too.

Son, there’s someone I want you to meet.
Random Kazka’s Band Talk
It’s Kazka!
The Band does it again!
They’re dead! They’re all dead! And it was my fault!
Leaves rustling
He’s all washed up.
Gwanda “You’re drunk off your arse all the time, because of some tart”
He’s so handsome.
Well well, If it isn’t Kazka.
How did this happenstance happen to happen in this stance
Is it too late to be a developer?
“For your crimes against Gruum’s Bloodline, I charge you with protection of Raq.“

--------------------------------------------
Back to Present
10am. Raining. Yellow hood The Guild is in the distance.

Raq
“Hey. You good? You were staring at me for a while.”

Kazka: …

It occurs to Kazka that he didn’t know who or what attacked them in Avery’s Household.

Episode 2:

Raining, 
The Gear is smoking. Bewwwwww.
Before it was weightless. Now it’s dead weight. Your arms feels like you’re carrying 15lbs on each arm.

Back to Bar
Irish Bartender

Takes a big ring of keys.
Bartender
Both of you. Kazka’s room. With me.
I told you to bring her back to her home, not make a full circle and bring her back to the guild, what’s the matter with you.

…

Ah. Okay. I understand the situation.

Little Lady, my you’ve grown. I’m sorry that all this has happened to you. You’ll have your chance to return home, but not anytime soon.

Oh, I… we never established how I know you.
My name is Gwanda. Gwanda of the Guild. I was raised by halflings.

She’s a portly wood elf Looks young. As all elves do.

She has a ring, the one she used before from when Kazka wrapped ethereal tentacles around her mouth to keep from speaking.

Kazka Arcana check for age

I’ve managed this fine establishment for centuries. I knew you when you were just this tall. When your uncle Gruum would visit. He was a man’s man, that one. He was the one that brought Kazka here.

Did Avery never tell you about your uncle?

Hmmm… Listen. You both can’t stay here. Lass, I kept you safe from the badge on Avery’s behalf, but this is too much. People came by. Posted this up on the bounty. Take a look.
500 Gold
“Raq’quoshet” Wanted ALIVE only.

This is the adventurer’s guild. The whole lot’ll want to take a piece of this action. I can keep you from authorities as best I can, but not from these shady ne’er do wells. I can’t keep watch behind you until all of this blows. You’ll need to rely on your own strength from that.

So. Kazka. Of the Band. What now?

Oh, hold on. I gotta get something.
Talk amongst each other

There’s a madman, who I still can’t believe, an RSF Chairman? (Ranlean Science facility) looking for this poor girl. And you enter a blood bond with her? Through infernal magic? How bizarre.

A Map of Western Cearne. 
“A map of Caerne. And Ranlean to boot.”

“I also went down and talked to someone about that thing on you, Raq. the machinery. I can smell it’s not working. Burnt.”
“This.. isn’t something my magic can fix. Yes, I can fix a tear in a shirt, but this contraption is nothing I’ve seen before. I can’t fix what I don’t understand. Would you like me to try?”
And Kazka, what about the Rain Temple you used to go to?

…
“I have to go. Bar calls.”
Gwanda stops at the door.

Kazka… Maybe it’s time you go home? I don’t mean this as ‘I’m tired of having you here. To be honest, it’s quite nice having you here. Security. Chores.”

Kazka, there’s something I’ve been meaning to talk to you about. The unsettling things I’ve seen from you.

Looks at Raq
“Do you want her here for this talk?”

…

“Kazka. More often than not, you talk in your sleep. You writhe in pain as these apparitions appear from your body. Long, dark, purple ooze like a kraken’s arms.I can’t make sense of it, I’ve not seen it before, and that’s a lot coming from a guildmaster.”

I think it’s time you do go home. You started unraveling with the little one. The halfling. The cave job. I never got to meet him, but Gruum expressed concern about you after that. And when he went.. It was like watching you turn into someone else.

And then Fumir left. And that was the straw that liquified the camel whole. You’ve not been the same since.

I met your father once. Precisely once. I remember it. He was larger than life.

We elves… we can taste magic, did you know? Not taste, but… we see it. Hear it. Differentiate it. Like the wetness of air when you’re close to the sea, and the smell of the salt. And no two manas from the same person are alike. Not twins, not brothers.

Your mana… is exactly like your dad’s. It’s unsettling. I look at you and I see two people superimposed in front of each other. And the mana, it gets weaker over time. With these short lives that you non-elves lead, that’s to be expected. But your mana is getting stronger the more you drink and suffer.

Go home. Center yourself. Find direction. Review the source of your power. You won’t be able to keep her safe if you don’t.

I’ll get Raq.
Is there anywhere you can go, Raq?

Father to One, Father to All: Charles Oneshot
The Forgotten Adventure
Long ago, you embarked on a quest with your party; one you’ve grown attached to. The quest was for a weapon, said to faintly glow a crimson red, a red ruby in the hilt of the handle. Legends say that the weapon was wielded by generals, responsible for countless victories in history.

 This is how the Adventure went:

The Seedling

The party mage senses a strong magical presence in a broken fountain. The ranger identifies it as a type of pine, native to a forest hundreds of miles away. This is notable, for the ruins you are to enter are desolate. Sand blows past you, rustling the piles of bones by the entrance. Somehow, this pine seedling is growing despite a lack of moisture.

Do you uproot it to be examined or leave it be? It may not survive the coming winter.

The Trap
You remember at some point a trap right after the entrance. The rogues had no issue going past it, but… you don’t remember what it was exactly. Something with the floor?

Signs of Felidae
As your party travels deeper into the dungeon ruins, you remember identifying the decor of Felidae; The Cat God.

Last time you were here, you remember a large podium, and the smell of dander. You pass the room with no issue.

The Battle
Your party had encountered a necromancer and an army of undead.  Frightened by what you saw, you and an injured member flee, leaving the rest of your party to be eaten alive in front of a large, frozen door.
...when you come to, you see that the barbarian that carried you out had expired to his wounds. Eric. That was his name. You take his ax and return it to his tribe. After this, you take a season off from adventuring. You take quests you know you can handle, but the excitement is gone. You start a family, and enjoy a simple life.
...
Prompted by your son’s letter, you don your armors and leave, almost forgetting the blood soaked map that Eric had been making as your former party advanced into the ruins.

(Completed)

























Party Link
Arthur (Drew): You’re not sure, but you think that your son saw you in tears during a vulnerable moment. What was that moment?

Uthal (Brandon): Shortly after meeting with a female friend, the fledgling Goliath seems distant to you. Who was that woman, and what was your relationship with her?

Durin (Keanu): You helped him climb the ranks of his faith, sacrificing something you cherish for him. How did you help the orphan dwarf, and at what cost?

Jegolas (Joey): The teenage Dark Elf got into some trouble at a brothel, and was on his way to become a slave. How did you help, and how do you think he’ll one day return the favor?

Discovered Lorebooks
Yellow Blood: Necromancy

Edited Dec 17 2022
(Beihorn Duskrest, elf who dabbled in dark revival magic)
This story focuses on dark magic more.

Idea
An infection that was encased in ice, now exposed to the world.
Magic that destroys red blood cells. 
-Story has to be magic related, the science part is already covered

The journal details the study of necromancy. Written by a necromancer, it details his process. How they would kill small animals and practice bringing them back to life. The author tested just how far they could go. How damaged the creature could be before the spell failed.

“...The squirrels with the slit throats would bleed out of their necks like waterfalls. It would all gush out fairly quickly. Cleaning up was a mess. The 2nd trial fared better. With the slit throat sewed up, they lasted a whole 10 seconds longer before slumping down motionless. The ones I crushed with a rock would only twitch their legs back to life. Specimens should be healed before they’re resurrected. Will this scale to humanoids?”
…………………...

The following chapters detail how they continued to practice as they got older, keeping it a secret from their friends and family. 

“It was something like a game, hearing the rumors about how graverobbers had dug up the cemetery for the 3rd time this year. If they ever caught me, I’d be hanged.


The bodies I recovered are doing well. They’re moving around, but decomposition continues. One of them fell over my soup. They’re aimless. No kind of head activity. Can I make them do chores?

Hasn’t been dead in quite some time. Some bodies were unusable.

Should I dig up my mother?”
………………………..

It then details their blunders.

“Entry 26 (the words are messily scrawled). One of them bit me. Fine tuned my spell to make them smarter. Guess that part of the brain for hunger was revived. Bit off 3 of my left hand fingers.”

The book ends there.
…………………...

At the end of the back cover, a Minute Lesser Animate Dead Spell Scroll (practically a scrap of paper.) Can reanimate the dead for 20 seconds. Can be used by Clerics Druids or Wizards. (Mention this to the DM to get the Scroll) Obtained by St. Gabriel.



Scales of the Shore: A Blue Water Dragon Informational
It’s a small picture book of Blue Water Dragons.

Deep in the oceans of the world lies the Blue Water Dragon, a fearsome creature that has been responsible for the deaths of many merchant ships due to careless route planning. They are incredibly aggressive and will attack any creature that they see on sight. They live along the sea shores, but some have been known to live as far as 30 miles inland.

Not to be confused with Sea Dragons, as Blue Water Dragons have wings.

Blue Dragons are immune to poison and cannot be exhausted, paralyzed or restrained through magical means. They seem to be able to sense things without their vision, as far as 60 feet away. Any magical flame can be quenched by them that we know of.

They have been known to breathe a salt spray that freezes anything immediately. Alternatively, they can also emit a steam spray, scalding anything as far as 60ft. Can create, destroy or control water at will.

Friar Birel Lialdon: Life of a Elven Follower
This book details one follower of the Church of the First. The autobiography is a pilgrimage that goes West following the trail of the Demigod Ein. He follows the place where Ein lit the signal fires that kept the west cities safe from the savage attacks. Past the South waters where he fought off his fallen brothers and sister. Birel Lialdon continued his pilgrimage until the city of Lyalondeshe where he grew tired of travel.

Some say he was visited by the demigod Ein himself. Given a part of his blue flame, his soul. The flame was placed in a giant brazier in the center of the Basilica that Birel started. This flame is said to survive any strong wind. No matter how small the giant flame shrivels to, the core flame stays constant.



Eastern Affairs: War of the East (or lack thereof)
The Tiefling/Orc War
The Kingdom of Lostia has had centuries of war campaigns. At some point they were at war with every society around them. Despite their ferocity and incredibly enduring metal war machines, Lostia has neither won nor lost any war they’ve been involved in due to far too much infighting. Their deserts are filled with abandoned machinery.

As small incursion groups, Lostia Orcs have been incredibly efficient. Their raiding parties are to be feared, as they employ any technologies and weapons available to them.

So long as you stick to the coast, you should be fine.Orcs are very careful not to engage with the water serpents that plague their coasts.

Farm Beasts: The Goblin Plague
The book details Goblins and their pestilence. Goblins are remnants of the Biomancer of Nier, who had genetically manipulated the races around the kingdom to forge his own race. Goblins were his strain of soldiers meant to tire the opposition out through sheer number. As a byproduct, the Goblins multiply quickly, reaching adulthood in a mere 5 years.

Having an average span of 25 years, goblins are short lived. Whatever knowledge they gain is not passed down as well as other goblinoid cultures. These creatures are not strong, nor enduring or intelligent. But they are nimble and creative with what they use as weapons.

They were genetically designed to be able to impregnate any female from any humanoid race and several species of pig, as their genetic makeup is constantly breaking down with each generation.

Ethical Biomancers estimate for Goblins to go extinct within 8 generations (200 years).

Elven Gods
One way or another, the group has learned that elves worship a small pantheon of gods. One of them seems to be a trickster.

Hollows
People whose souls are taken. Empty Vessel. Related to Dr Podrigo, Dhampicillin, a plant that creates mana. (Look at Headcrabs from Half-Life for reference of where the disease comes from. Patient Zero)

Church of the First
Long ago, there was a pantheon of gods, each taking the form of white-winged spirits, bathing in golden flames and protected by swirling rings of gold and marble. At first, these gods created and cared for the few sentients of the world. As the world grew so did the god’s contempt for their creations. Being immortal meant seeing their children make the same mistakes again, never learning. Over time, they grew tired of leading their flock. They became enticed by their children’s discoveries and transmutation of the world. They would travel down in pairs, assuming the form of their creation and manipulating the mortals. Soon, they played with them like toys, living vicariously through them. For they could not do what they did without permanently sacrificing their form. No one god had kept their mortal form for longer than a day. One of the gods was known as Ein. He stood, declaring this practice wrong. To this, the other gods attacked Ein, forcing Ein with them to the mortal realm. There, one amongst many, the gods permanently took his rings of protection. They summoned several calamities then returned to their God-Home without him, saying they would change their ways if he could find his way back home, alone. A feat no single god had done. Without his rings, Ein could be hurt. He needed the light of the Gods Bath, to retain his godly powers. He was doomed to become mortal and perish. With the help of new friends and a demon turned ally, Ein traveled the world. Together they survived storms and cold snaps; heat waves and wars. Countless disasters, all to reach the tallest peak in the land. From there, he revealed his 6 winged form and attempted to fly home, without a god as a partner.

Ein flew for years nonstop to reach the Gods-home. Along the way, his wings began to molt and fall from the stress. The bitter gods send opposition. Ein uses the last of his golden flame to escape them. When he reached the gates, Ein’s wings had been broken beyond repair, only one left wing hanging on a thread and the remaining right one barely functional. Seeing their brother return, the gods kept their word. They vowed to stop their ways. But after a few centuries, they regressed back. Who could stop them? Ein had decided to return, for he found those below more godlike in nature. Before leaving, Ein destroys the Gods Bath and poisons the clouds with an ever growing bed of thorns. Once below, Ein hides his rings and stows away the rest of his flame in a brazier. Once again adopting his mortal form, he returns to his friends. With his golden flame gone, Ein was mortal. After his passing, his friends and family erected a shrine in his name; With the Gods Bath broken, the remaining gods could not stop the overgrowth. One by one, they fell to the mortal world. Not the first god to come below, Ein was the first to stay permanently. “It is not where we’re from or where we’re going, but how we get there, and the help we get along the way.” Be the First. For you may not be the last.”

House of Basalt
Harut and Marut are two twin gods who were trapped in the mortal realm in their female form. The betrayer Eyan had forsaken his older brothers and sisters, who regularly bathed in the waters of the Sudatory to retain their godly powers. Harut, Marut and their siblings would regularly visit their mortal creations and do what they can to help out in little ways.

Eyan grew tired of a god's life. Acting on impulse, Eyan traveled by himself to the mortal world rather than waiting for a partner. There he found that he was stranded. The siblings thought this a chance to learn a lesson, leaving him to come home. He would have to fly to the highest peak on the opposite side of the world. Upon reaching the peak, they would travel and pick him up.

All was well, but little did they know, Eyan had developed a grudge. Having consorted with a devil, Eyan had brought home a vial of Frostfire; a mythical flame that freezes all it touches . After putting broken glass in the Sudatory, the frostfire spread quickly. Soon the gods fell to the mortal world.

Harut and Marut survived.After some time, Eyan found them. Eyan found all his siblings dead, save for these two. He was interested in restarting their godly bloodline, and forced himself upon his two sisters. He had his golden flame tucked away. 

After Eyan left to gather home supplies, the sisters fled. They etched a home in a face of basalt columns, trusting no one. Soon they gave birth to their children, a boy and two girls. They cast the boy out, giving him to a lone mother.

The world is a terrible place, and those who betray you are not to be trusted. Often you will have to craft your own safety.

Jasonic Lore
Legislator’s Gavel
The legislators gavel. So the legislators gavel is an artifact currently in the possession of the Darkwaters. It belonged to their ancient ancestor, “The Legislator.”



The Darkwater Family
The Darkwaters are wealthy tiefling descendants of The Legislator, who had a hand in the creation of the law system long ago. One particular generation, labeled "the Insurgents," were siblings that shared ideals with their deity, Anarch, and brought corruption to the court of law. They were composed of 4 siblings: Ivan the Judge, Roman the Executioner, and the Darkwater Twins, Dante and Evie Darkwater, the King and Queen pins of their mafia known as "the Jury."
Ivan the Judge is the father to Ripley Darkwater and grandfather to Dickie Darkwater, who is unaware of all this corruption of law. Although the Insurgents lived long ago, their corruption still exists. Ripley continues to be a corrupt lawyer and members of "the Jury" still wander the streets, doing the bidding of anybody willing to pay, ie. the Darkwaters.
The Rot Wizard
A mysterious figure that lives in the forest close to Ranlean.
He seems to wear a leather suit that protects him from infectious diseases at all times.

No one knows who this person really is. Just that they keep a fair distance from everyone in his mushroom garden. Nice enough, this wizard. He (Or she?) waves at passersby and gives directions towards Ranlean.

Sol Darak
DM Notes on the Darak Family
Lu’s Echo is Sol’s Companion
Sol’s Companion is not Lu’s Echo.
Sol does not know that he’s summoning his brother, Lu.

He wanted to summon the greatest hero, not realizing that to his subconscious, the greatest hero to Sol is his older brother Lu.
A young Owlin Warlock from Caspa, the flying city of owls. He attends an academy to learn magic.
He finds talent in summoning, bringing forth an ancient soul into a statue. Shortly after, he learns to summon ‘the greatest hero’ ancestor into a battleworn set of armor from his family’s treasure. The armor kneels before him, solidifying their companionship.

The room of an owl-human hybrid student at an academy for magic would likely reflect their unique identity and family history. The room would be spacious, with high ceilings and large windows to accommodate the hybrid's wingspan.
The walls would be adorned with family portraits and artifacts, showcasing the lineage of heroes from which the hybrid comes. A large bookcase would be filled with ancient tomes and spellbooks, indicating the hybrid's scholarly pursuits. The desk would be cluttered with papers and quills, evidence of their diligent study.
The bed would be large and luxurious, with soft pillows and blankets made from the finest feathers. The hybrid's wardrobe would include a variety of clothing, from practical robes for magic practice to elegant outfits for formal occasions.
One corner of the room would feature a perch for the hybrid to rest on when they need a break from standing on their legs. The perch would be adorned with comfortable cushions and overlook a large window, providing a stunning view of the night sky and the moon.
The room would also have a variety of magical items, from enchanted lanterns to crystal orbs for scrying. The hybrid would keep their own personal magical artifacts on display, including a wand or staff that reflects their unique magical abilities.
Overall, the room of an owl-human hybrid student at an academy for magic would be a reflection of their identity and family history, as well as their dedication to their studies and magical pursuits.


Lu Darak
The older brother of Sol Daral. Following the footsteps of another family ancestor, he taps into ‘Echo Magic’, reaching into the future to summon parts of his future self. The parts of the hero that he summons is the exact same armor that his younger brother, Sol, summons.

The Patron
From an unfathomable realm of agony, suffering, and perpetual devastation, the Patron was summoned into existence. This ethereal entity, akin to a spirit, possessed the ability to alter its form at will. Its essence exuded a trinity of mana, radiating hues of green, purple, and red. Manifesting as a dark mass, intertwined with an array of fiery colors, it bore horns and tails.
Upon entering the realm of Artheria, the Patron found respite from ceaseless torment. This new world appeared akin to a paradisiacal haven. Endowed with telekinetic powers, the Patron possessed the uncanny ability to discern the intentions of other living beings. Instead of relying on verbal discourse, it communicated through emotions, as such was the custom within its original plane. Communication there thrived solely through the language of annihilation, destroy or be destroyed.
The summoning of this entity into the mortal realm was the work of The Scholar, a human wizard who delved into forbidden fairy lore. The Patron was brought forth with the purpose of safeguarding humanity from the merciless onslaught of the Orcs, who sought to inflict genocide upon their kind. The Patron's native realm was perpetually engulfed in an invisible inferno, which the Scholar harnessed to provide warmth to the humans during the Era of Ice.
Initially, the Scholar restrained the Patron with ethereal chains, endeavoring to establish communication with the colossal spirit. Once a dialogue could be established, the Scholar forged a pact, communicating through the medium of emotions.
The agreement was struck. In exchange for the Patron's formidable abilities, the Scholar committed to maintaining the presence of the being in the mortal realm, safeguarding the gates through which it had entered for as long as possible.
At least, that was the Scholar's understanding.
The Patron harbored reservations. and mistrust towards the diminutive creature and its immense power, deceived the Scholar.
The pact was sealed, yet the price to sustain the gates cursed the bloodline of the Scholar for generations to come. The once clear skies became shrouded in a somber gray hue, not from smoke but from an unending swarm of lesser demons hailing from the Patron's abode.
On that fateful day, the Orcish war came to an abrupt halt. Their numbers decimated by the relentless onslaught of the demons that descended upon them. When the orcs finally relented, the demons sought to remain in this newfound paradise.
The exact method employed by the Scholar to banish the demons remains shrouded in mystery. Nonetheless, the Scholar managed to accomplish this feat, albeit leaving two portals in their wake: the Strixhaven portal and the Fire Genasi portal. Nevertheless, the damage had been done. Inexplicable events began to unfold across the world, with reports of nightmarish creatures spreading chaos, death, and madness.
The fate of the Patron after the pact's inception remains unknown.
To this day, people refer to this cataclysmic event as "The Promise that Shattered the World."

Orcish Sword
(Yoshua)
Discovered in Dryad’s Ruins (S2)
Elf Bleed


The sword is made from pig iron. It is rough, uneven. As if the blade was rushed. Has a shimmer of what looks like broken glass along the sharpened blade. The blade vibrates slightly in the presence of anyone with elvish ancestry (high, wood or dark elf.)

There are 8 scores etched by the hilt of the blade.

(Inflicts additional 1d6 damage to elves)

Destroyed by Elves as an offering to their Elven God. Yoshua lost it. Stated by Mikey since the campaign was on indefinite hiatus.
Elven Ring
(Elikaen)
Taken from the Dryad (S2)
Spirit of the Tool


Green Gem inlay
Dark wood ring with 2 silver lines

Used to be bigger, it seems. Part of a wand or rod of some sort.

Draws upon the charm of ancient gods to manifest the soul of an object, awakening it. The ring takes the stored mana within the gem and spends it, breaking the gem. The mana is then channeled through the weave, returning back to the gods.

Destroyed, used to create the Rod of Absorption. Stated by Mikey since the campaign was on indefinite hiatus.

On Patrons
The usual story is that a warlock makes a promise with a demon, and this demon gives them a fraction of their power. In exchange for this power, the warlock is compelled to do the demon’s bidding. Often this demon is godlike, untouchable by the warlock.
But what if that’s not the case? What if the demon is made vulnerable, just as much as the warlock? As if the promise goes both ways?

Introducing the Lesser Demon’s Pact: The Magic of Knowing a Demon’s True Name.
Magic of True Name - A rare ability that can control the demons unleashed during ‘The Promise that Shattered the World”. When someone speaks the demon’s true name, their spells are counteracted. If a pact is made, then the player gains their abilities and spells, becoming a Warlock.

Magic casting is unique and fun. Make it as unique as possible.

Fragments of Magic (Hard System)
How Magic Works
In Artheria, magic is still largely unknown, even by those who study it
There are various organizations studying it to this day. Libraries, Guilds, etc.
Some societies use it as a power source
It seems to be present in all things, living or nonliving
Sentient creatures can control it at will, specifically those that can communicate with spoken language.
Some non-sentient creatures can still use magic, although primitive methods.
The Sight, Shape, Sound, Noise and Feel of magic can vary incredibly. Spellcasting is personal.
If raw: Blue.
If from a God: White/Yellow.
If from a Demon: Red/Orange.
If from a Necromantic God: Purple/Black.
If from an older/nature/fey god: Green/Brown/Blue.
Various factors can change the appearance of Magic casting.
Source of Mana
Mentor
The Environment of the caster
Elves can uniquely taste magic. Most dare not to, since it can be like eating rotten flesh.
About a 1/10th of the world can cast magic. In Order:
Elves
Tieflings
Other Races
Humans
Halflings
Orcs
There seems to be a limit to how much magic a person can use in a set amount of time. Any more, and they experience Mana Burn.




Wizards use ingredients to cast magic
Some advanced wizards have a spellcasting focus where they can cast prepared ley lines that float in the air or ground. The leylines project from the spellcasting focus.
Certain Wizards will mark or tattoo alchemical symbols on their skin and hands to help with the spellcasting.

Clerics and Paladins usually have to speak and are bathed in a godlight when casting spells
Violent magic can alter the spellcaster’s eyes.
Druidic Magic is often very quiet. There is an element of visual trickery.
Demonic Magic is very unpredictable.
Tiefling Magic almost always darkens the environment and has a verbal component to it that lowers the caster’s voice to an unnatural degree.


Odd, Unusual Forms and Systems of Magic
Hard Magic - Lots of rules on how the magic comes to be. There is satisfaction once the spell has been cast.
Soft Magic -Magic happens without explanation or rules. Can be used as a justification of the impossible.


Abstract Concepts of Thought, in Real World Flesh Avatars. These avatars are slaves to the wizard, and try to break free. When the control is broken, the Binding cannot be done in the same fashion. The Concept remembers this binding and is summoned without limitation into the world. Often, the spellcaster is killed. The Avatar does not live long and is usually dispelled after some time. Seconds to days, not shorter than a few days.

Spells from plant seeds.

Magical Ability comes from a physical ailment. A person with scoliosis can turn to a snake. Often it is linked, but can take different forms.

A series of spells in the ringing of bells.

Shadow magic
The second type would be the spiritshadows, which are bound to each individual inhabitant of the Castle soon after their birth and again when they come of age. The shadowguards for children are able to alter their shape in various useful ways and serve to protect them until they come of age and bind their own personal spiritshadow. Big spoilers ahead for those who haven't read it. The spiritshadows are actually magical creatures from another world/dimension. The Castle inhabitants can use their light magic to send their spirits to this world, and while there they find a magical creature and use a mixture of light magic and the third magic to bind the creature to their shadow. The creature then returns to their world as their new spiritshadow, losing certain aspects and abilities but gaining others (like the ability to feed off light to grow stronger and regenerate). Many of the creatures have powerful abilities and magic themselves, and sometimes parts of that carry over into their shadow form. (For instance, since they were originally made of cloud creatures, Storm Sheperds can still alter their shape somewhat, unlike most adult spiritshadows, and use shadow lightning bolts.)

The idea of spirit shadows means there are soulbinders. People who go out looking to turn these sentient creatures into artifacts.

Simple Lineage Magic. Bakers, whose magic lies in their bodies. Their sweat and skin has magical properties that makes their bread delicious. Quite useless in most scenarios.

Magic from dietary consumption. Magic Eaters or something.

Magic from Powders thrown or applied.

Magic that only happens in the right environment. Such as a powerful lightning storm only on a cloudy day with someone who’s blood is of a powerful mage in the past.

Demon Friendship.

Magic from Language

Spellthief- Renders another spellcaster unable to cast the spell.

Cultish Favor from a corrupt, forgotten god.

Writing a Session - The Angry GM
A campaign begins with a goal and a major event to set the PCs on the path to resolving it and it ends when that story is resolved. Arcs begin with the revelation of some particular story element and end when that element is resolved or dealt with. Adventures begin with motivations and end with resolutions. Encounters begin with the posing of a dramatic question and end when the question is answered. And even individual actions begin with a situation, the choice of an action, a resolution, and a consequence. The game is like one of those pregnant Russian dolls with a smaller pregnant Russian doll in her stomach who, herself, has a smaller pregnant Russian doll inside.
(Mikey: This whole article is amazing and concise. I’m about to read this along with any session I plan out.

Magic’s Law of Exchange
Much like the rule of energy conservation, magic cannot be destroyed. It can only be transferred into another form. 
	But unlike the natural law, magic’s depth of conversion can occur on the other side of the world.

100 limited entities in the world. When an entity is destroyed, it somehow is transmuted, taking another form in the world.

Mikey’s Post: In working with your co writers, the fellow DMs.
I created the Magic Law of Conservation for this reason.
There may be times where you don’t agree with your fellow DM by working together in a world. Often they say that in DnD you’re building a story together. But dude, what if they decide to make your favorite race losers? Or kill your favorite hero? Return this kindness by STORY COMBAT.

What do I mean by this? So. The Magic Law of Conversion. Long story short, magic in this world is not destroyed. It’s locked in an ecosystem that’s constantly changing. And every entity in this world has points (out of 100). Through creative story writing, you can knock off some points from an entity, killing it. This creates an imbalance in the system. You destroy an entity worth 5 points, so now the world’s points go from 100 to 95.

You can now use these 5 points to introduce new entities into the story. Whatever you want, so long as the rule of conservation is maintained; only 100 points of entities at a time.

(The Law of Magic Conservation became a personal use thing. Not fair to ask others to abide by it. Too limiting. Best used for a hard magic system.)

Example: Dragons and Tieflings (Introduced into the world by Jason and Mikey.)
Dragons are worth 2 points, Tieflings are worth 3, 5 points in total.
I want to rid the world of dragons to make the tiefling race stronger. I’m attached to tieflings because I wrote the lore for them. Jason is most likely attached to his lore as well. We’ll both do anything storywise to keep them alive. (With consent of course.)

Dragons are also classified as Creatures: Few. Dragons can add to their 2 points by absorbing another entity. They can also lose their points when another entity tries to absorb them.

Tieflings are a Race: Average Population, worth 3 Points. This means they have the upper hand in terms of killing the dragons through sheer number of units.

In a session, a DM should write the session with a planned change in points or entity number, minimum of 1 point, maximum of the destruction of an entity.

This becomes a thing of math, in accordance with the magic system.
Simple war of killing the dragons. 3(Tieflings)-2(Dragons)=1(Tieflings). The Cost for slaying all the dragons into extinction is the death of all the tieflings. The 1 represents the last of the Tieflings (preferably 1 person, to retain the chance of repopulation.)

So how does Jason’s Dragon lore fight against this equation? By using other entities in the magic system to increase the value of his dragons. This is when the math problem gets bigger. What other entity does he employ? What edge do I give my entities? This is the DM’s Story Combat. We are the gods that are fighting against each other for supremacy.

In fairness, The session needs to be written with a way of reintroduction for the other DM to retain his lore. If my tiefling lore manages to erase his dragon entities, then they need to be able to come back into the world. How? By the creation of a magic artifact: Dragon Eggs. Or maybe the last dragon egg, idk, whatever Jason wants. This is fair. This gives us a challenge to retain our lore.

Whoever loses their lore due to destruction gets the available points to introduce new lore. I think this is fair.

What makes a story?
Beginning, Conflict, Resolution. Fine tune that to your liking. Add more into it. All stories are stories of transformation. 

How do I make people enjoy my story?
Make it relatable. Ask what the player’s favorite setting is. Then give it a twist. Somelike like the 80/20 rule, where the 80 is their setting, and the 20 is the twist.
Tailor it to their character. This is why a session 0 is important. When you know the character that they want to play, you can give them several challenges to test their player. Part of session zero is asking them 3 to 5 questions that give you an idea of the goal that motivates that character. I personally organize everything in 4 sections: Physical, Mental, Social, and Financial (Logistics). Do they want to become stronger to survive combat? Do they seek knowledge? Increase their magical ability? Find a Tutor? Learn more of the world? Do they want to protect someone that they know? Get powerful artifacts? Become rich?

All stories are tales of transformation. The character from the beginning of their story should be considerably different when their story ends. This is what makes a good story.

Where do I get inspiration from?
Any popular show that you like. There’s a section here to help you get inspired.

How to tell a good story (from various technique on youtube)
-Show, don’t tell. Use varying,  clever words.
-Use evidence to support your claims
-Make the readers want it. This goes back to the character, and seeing them change and grow.
-Concrete facts, not abstract feelings when describing the world. Bring the world out.

Inspiration for fellow DMs
It’s awesome that my friends are now joining me as Dungeon Masters (DMs) in our D&D adventures. I really like this.

I joined the D&D Club in high school for 2 sessions. We played the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 edition, and the club was exactly what one would expect: a gathering of high school outsiders. I vividly recall how we projected the battlemap on a screen, allowing us to visually track our characters' positions during combat.

I chose to play as a fighter, and at that time, my creativity was soaring. I was captivated by the limitless possibilities of storytelling. Artistry ran through my veins even then.

One day, on a scrap of paper, I sketched Veilo—an original character inspired by Vahn from the Legend of Legaia video game. The inner child within me yearned to shape Vahn into something beyond the confines of his virtual world.

Thus, I crafted a human fighter, equipped with unique weapons reminiscent of Vahn's tonfa. Through this process, I realized that, for the first time, I had the opportunity to bring forth a character entirely of my own creation—a character akin to the likes of Harry Potter or Bobby Pendragon from the Pendragon Series.


Then I remember playing my character in combat. I felt the anxiety of contributing to combat, wanting to do damage to the monsters we were fighting. The DM at the time made it feel so visceral, more damaging than anything I've felt in video games. It felt a little more real.

After the game, I felt that I wanted more. I want to develop my character, make him stronger. I went home that day, and drew my character a few more times, trying to make him more real. I was just a kid projecting, wanting to be a hero in my own story. That’s what most people want to be. The main character in their own novel.

The feeling persisted. Thus, my interest in game development. At the time, that was impossible, as I didn’t know coding was even a thing, or how a kid could start doing that with my limited resources. I thought you were required to go to school for that. Thanks to 2023 technology, everyone can just do it themselves on even a low-end computer.

Years passed after my first time geeking out with a bunch of high school punks with a paper and pencil, playing what felt like a video game without the controller. I tried playing the essence of a tabletop game again with Kuya. On roll20.net, I created a poor story and had Kuya play with me. He was a fighter that ended up talking his way out of a fight with a bear. I didn’t have a world, a ruleset or anything, so it didn’t feel like a real game. It just felt like pretending. 

Then, Kuya decided to buy the beginners set of DnD, 5th edition. That fueled my interest yet again. This time I spent hours going through the rules, learning what I could.

After 50+ sessions, I’m where I’m at now, and I’m still inexperienced. My creative ability has improved, yes, but it took time and a lot of errors. A lot of disappointing my friends with poorly written stories that made them fall asleep. Often I was disappointed in myself.

What makes it worth it though, is crafting stories and events that we made together. Where we can remember them like we do Harry Potter scenes. And I’m in awe of that. We made that. Together. It’s not planned. It’s all spontaneous. These scenes that could happen in movies, happen right here, in someone’s living room. WE did that. Together. It’s like we’re authors working on a story together, where one day it’ll end up on the big screen, like Critical Role.

That’s what makes it worth the hours of planning.

In my dreams, these stories take a comic book form, in all of our libraries. And when we miss each other or want to relive the events of our fictional selves, we can go through and read those books or novels.

Medieval Justice - Mikey Synopsis
 In 1000 AD England, people would take an oath, saying what their event recollection was the truth. They would do odd things like hold a burning hot iron in court. If it healed, they were telling the truth. Seems that anything beneficial was seen as the work of God then.

People would also get a champion to fight for them in a trial by combat. The winning champion would be seen to be favored by god, thus, their recollection was truth. The King put a stop to Trial by Combat. Spoken words only would win court cases. Even back then, smaller courts were held for the severity of the crime.

People could recite bible verses, sparing them from death. The more you know about God, the better. People would also run into the churches and stay there for 40 days, protected from arrest. This became known to be ‘Seeking Sanctuary.” People could choose to surrender to trial or exile themselves to leave the country.

The Gods don’t exist.
Gods do exist, so we should gain their favor to improve our lives.
Why does this Nation deserve this resource or land?
These group of humanoids should be genocided.
This Faction is up to no good.
These laws are unjust and need to be changed.
These ceremonies are savage and need amendment.
This entity is changing for worst and needs changing.

The Last of the First
Elikaen and St. Gabriel
It has been a week since the previous party disbanded.
Battle: The Fight with Ivoras
Elikaen has finally found the person she’s looking for: Her former mentor. He’s using the Einkhala Artifacts as weapons to destroy the Northern King.
St. Gabriel has learned that Elikaen’s mentor has joined with the House of Basalt. The House has taken control of the Elder Dragons.
End of Battle: Elikaen has lost her sight, slashed across the eyes. St. Gabriel loses a leg.
Chorbishop Cali restores him by using magic to transplant her own leg (A strong kind of magic unique to the Church, taught by the higher church officials.

Timeskip of 1 Month.
Elikaen’s sight is restored through her goddess Bina. The magic is strong, and has left Bina weak. She requires mana to return to her former strength. (Elikaen’s spells are weakened.)
Cali walks on crutches, missing a leg.

Elikaen talks with her deity. Bina tells her to kill the mentor. Pray in the Elven Temples. Break the artifacts to restore her power. She’s tapped into the dark magic that she knows for Elikaen’s sake. 

Cali talks to St. Gabriel. The God Ein is no longer what he is. She gives him soul gems, adapted from dragonglass. These are to capture his essence.

They’re up against an enemy. This enemy is using the artifacts of the einkhala.
They’re racing to the Summit, where the god Ein is being held.
St. Gabriel is fighting the House of Basalt.
Elikaen’s mentor has joined the house of Basalt.
The House wants to destroy Ein. The Basalt God will absorb his power. They will use the power to destroy Amethyst Peak.

The Mentor will be given part of this absorbed power. He will then use this power to kill Marcus, the King of the North. King Marcus was formerly the mentor’s rival.

Part 1: The Battle
Part 2: The Dungeon to the Top.
The dungeon is filled with magic artifacts from the time of the Orc-Human War. It is powered by an old fairy generator. They can see mana signatures all throughout the structure.
A: The First Device kills a good number of Basalt Followers. An Orcish trap. After it is activated, They can use the remaining power of the dungeon to activate their own trap.
B: The Generator
The Generator is inactive. It can be overpowered or left alone. By leaving it alone, the last trap for them is deactivated. If overpowered, they are left in the dark, able to see the following trap.
C: The Titans
There is a dysfunctional titan that slows the two down. It can be made to help them in the final battle.
D: Ivoras’s Project Image
Part 3: The Final Battle

3 Vantages
Number
Sight
Additional Follower

Final Battle:
The God Ein has numerous chains around him.
Eli and Gabriel need to use the soul gems to absorb his waning power in 3 different slots.

House of Basalt Archers
Ivoras

One of them must distract Ivoras and 2 other fighters.
The other must fend off the archers.

One of the gems is destroyed by Ivoras. St. Gabriel can use himself as the last soul gem.
Elikaen delivers the final fatal wound, taking Ivoras down.


Elikaen’s Decision: Kill or Spare Ivoras the Mentor.
Kill: She gains the Mentor’s weapon, which changes to her weapon of choice.

Spare: the Mentor cures Elikaen of the corrupting power she’s gained to kill him. But the corruption continues.



St. Gabriel’s Decision: The power needs to take a form that St. Gabriel can control, as Ein’s power is becoming unstable. 
Kill Ein: His suffering ends. St. Gabriel becomes a god in his place, leading the Church. He is given mighty power to shape the world as he sees fit. The Church loses all power, their healing source gone. (Neutral Ending)

Seal Ein away. Ein is no longer who he once was. His power is locked away in gems. (Neutral Ending) This retains the power of the church.

2 Points of Worldbuilding each
Church of the First (2)
The Einkhala Artifacts (2)

Epilogue (2 Days after the fighting)
Elikaen has formed a group of her own.
Ending 1: This group follows her as the Mentor’s replacement. She uses this power to help the Northern King.
If Ending 2: The group disbanded or was absorbed. She spends her remaining days looking for a way to stop the corruption. She travels to the North, towards King Marcus.


St. Gabriel is given the title of presbyter. He is the speaker of his Church.
Ending 1: He displays this power by bringing back to life a former figure of the Church. They follow his godlike powers blindly. They create a church with the Fire Genasi.

If Ending 2: The Secret of Ein is kept from the Church. There is disarray within the Different First Churches as their power is no longer available. He travels to the Church of Anarch for answers.

If combat death:
Ein is destroyed. The Elder Dragons regain their power. They use it to destroy the House of Basalt.

Elikaen and St. Gabriel are both wounded severely, no longer able to continue their adventures.
A week passes. They look at each other and consider their adventures. They think of Argo, and Yoshua, before the sun sets.

Mikey: Powers of the Rot Wizard

Lvl 1
Necrotic Blast: The wizard can unleash powerful bursts of necrotic energy, causing damage and rotting away anything in its path.

Putrid Concoctions: The wizard can brew potent potions that induce various rot-related effects, such as disease, paralysis, or rapid aging.

Scent of Decay: The wizard can emit a powerful odor of decay, overwhelming their opponents' senses and distracting or disorienting them.

Lvl 2
Putrefying Aura: The wizard generates an aura of putrefaction, causing plants to wither, food to spoil, and organic matter to decompose rapidly in their vicinity.

Lvl 3
Decay Manipulation and Transmutation: The wizard can accelerate the process of decay, causing objects, plants, and even living beings to wither and crumble at their command. The wizard can transform objects into decaying versions of themselves, rendering them useless or unstable.

Fungal Growth: The wizard can summon and control various types of fungi, using them for offensive and defensive purposes or even as minions.

Pestilence Aura: The wizard emits an aura of disease and pestilence, causing those who come near to weaken and fall ill.

Rot Absorption: The wizard can absorb and harness decaying energy, using it to replenish their own vitality or strengthen their spells.



**I need help with The Rot Wizard.**
I'd like to flesh him out more. I want to understand the development and plans you've written for him.

Rot Wizard's Introduction
(DM: The Rot Wizard's first mention was about session 5, in the First Church in Ranlean. 

I had written the Rot Wizard superficially. Just someone to report back to Chorbishop Cali, confirm that there is in fact a Spellplague. The Constant wearing of the mask was to justify paranoia. Mushrooms around his cottage because I know that mushrooms grow from dead bodies and the like. I wanted his method of operation to be similar to Golgari from Magic the Gathering. I had also figured that dealing with dead people is something common medieval civilians avoid. Hence, why he lives alone.)

Further development
The Reveal, (After capturing Kori, Dr. Podrigo reveals he is the Rot Wizard. He is an unmorrowed as he calls it, someone who does not have the capacity to cast spells innately. Wizards have trace amounts of mana, not enough to cast spells like sorcerers can. But the Unmorrowed have no trace of magic whatsoever. Much like humans in the real world. Thus, they rely on magic artifacts.








Mikey’s Characters (Organized by Class)
‘It’s important as a DM to have a character of every class to understand them, thus giving the players in their campaigns a time to shine and be the hero of the hour.’

The 3 Pillars of the game are Combat, Adventure, and Social Encounters. Thus every character roster should have:


A melee fighter for combat
A ranged fighter for ranged combat
A magic user to show how magic works
An adventurer that can solve puzzles and get to through dungeons
A talker for social encounters

Barbarian
Human
Haeki
Unplayed

Does not state it, but wants power. His own army.

Bard
Half-Elf
Natali Bourbon
A Mapmaker and Historian.
She wants to travel the world and create a guide.
She’s writing a book called “Tales of Artheria: A guide to our world.”
She understands that the world is constantly changing. Even so, she wants to visit every continent of the world, every capital, so that her book will one day sit in every bookshelf. Preferably coffeeshop libraries.


Cleric
Jaufran
Human Life Cleric.
Age 40’s.
Worships the God of Life. He is borderline suicidal, and wishes to die towards a greater goal for his god.
Every chance he gets he’ll try to convert believers. His Temple is actually quite fun, and they plan little outings for everyone. PG13. The Presbyter and his wife are responsible for this.
He has a close friend, a devout believer who organizes fun events for Adults, 18+. Nightclubs, Brothels, etc.

“My goddess, Lliira the Lovely. Joybringer. The risen corner of every mouth. She is summer’s warmth.
I follow in her teachings as a father to his daughter. I do what I must to keep others safe. This means erecting barriers and doing the unthinkable.

A father will do anything for his daughters. As do I.

I don’t wish for you to go to a shrine in her name, or to give alms. All I ask is that on a golden spring eve, when the weather permits, you choose to spend it making music with friends, baking bread with family, rather than toiling the fields on someone else’s lands. The used day will not miss you like the day you lived.

Lliira will see to your joy. She will stretch the sunlight just a little bit farther for you. Cut short the nights that you must be alone. 



(Joke Character)



Druid
Off-White (Mentioned in Jason’s Tiefling Two Shot)

A White Wolf
Used to lead a pack of Red Wolves. Has come in contact with the Straphan Forest Spirit, who sees that the forest can benefit from his becoming a human.

New to the world as a humanoid, he is often awkward, has trouble with people, and still does a lot of his animalistic habits such as sleeping on the floor. He forgets that he’s a human sometimes.

The Straphan Forest Spirit will not see him again, and will not take back his ‘blessing’ until he proves himself to the beings of the forest.



Fighter
Veilo
Inspired by my first ever DnD Character, 3.5e
Ex-Soldier. Ratty Cloak. Special Helmet that is open at the face.

Veilo wants a world of peace. He works as a mercenary, but does his research to see if the mission can come to a clean end.

He’s conflicted about his participation in war. If you don’t join, innocents die. If you do, you feed into it. At the moment, he decides that this is better than ‘doing nothing and letting evil flourish’.

We have 20 questions students can apply to their characters to develop their character profiles:
1. What is your full name?
2. Does your name mean anything?
3. Who is in your immediate family?
4. What is your job? Do you like it?
5. Who do you get along with most? Least?
6. Who is your most important relationship?
7. Where do you live in the world?
8. Is your living environment urban, rural, or suburban?
9. How do you live? (are you neat, messy, artistic, spartan?)
10. How do you decorate your living space?
11. What is your favorite food, movie, song, colour?
12. What is your least favourite food, movie, song, colour?
13. How do you dress on a daily basis?
14. What do you choose to wear when you dress up?
15. What is your biggest pet peeve?
16. What is your biggest secret?
17. What is your favourite childhood memory?
18. What one moment from your past affects you today?
19. What do you want more than anything?
20. What is your ideal life?

 Veilo was the name of my great great grandfather. My mother told me that it meant the last one. What does this mean? I have no idea.

My immediate family would be me and my sister. My father was a good man.

My occupation is Soldier. Being a soldier has its ups and downs. When no one is looking, I try to affect as little lives as possible. This means capturing soldiers, keeping my soldiers under me away from civilians, and keeping the damage to a minimum.

I got along with my friends and family decently. I get along most with my Platoon. I got along the least with my above officers. I understand that they have to do certain things, practically war crimes, just following orders. For the benefit of the war front. I understand that too. But when you've seen the things that I have seen, and the devastation that your platoon allows, the unnecessary violence against women and children, for the sake of feeling in power, to pass the time, you would want to put a stop to that.

My important relationship would be with my sister. Our parents died in wartimes. We had to live off of the streets. Well I joined the war to earn a little bit of money for each of us. She managed to find a husband at a very young age, in the last moments that I had with her, I made a promise to protect her family for her. I'm not too close with her husband, but I do what I can for my nieces and nephews.

In the world, I live where the wars take me. In hotel rooms, it's intense.  I would say that I live with my brother-in-law, and my nieces and nephews. I live in a separate structure from them, practically an underground bunker.

My living environment is rural,  on the outskirts of town. Kind of like a Farmland.

I live very messy. One could say like a Spartan warrior, wherever whatever that means.  All of my weapons are maintained and cleaned close to my bed on a table. I start the day off with Turkish coffee. Coffee that is heated in  hot Sands. Occasionally I hunt. I enjoy the fruits and vegetables that my nieces and nephews grow.

My living space although very fundamental and basic, I do find myself decorating it with elements of Fire, and musical instruments. My sister enjoyed music.  For my little nieces and nephews I play the lute like instrument called an Oud.

I enjoy theater.

My least favorite food would be anything dry. My time as a soldier has taught me that dryer foods make you constipated. For this I enjoy soups.

On a daily basis I  wear something called a gutra.  Where I come from, there is plenty of sand and Sun.  The gutra  is a simple fabric that keeps both away from your face.  It can also be changed to whatever you need.

I also wear a very loose kind of cloak. A regular tunic, maybe baggy pants, and tie shoes.  Something that I can secure my feet too so I can run fast.

When I dress up, I like to dress in  various bright colors. Clean clothes. Something that reflects my culture.

My biggest pet peeve is when someone does not fully appreciate the weapons that they wield. That or any instruments, or things that they use on a daily basis. I myself enjoy ending the day by maintaining my weapons, even for a little while.

My biggest secret is that I enjoy feeling powerful. I enjoy dictating the future of someone's life. I felt this when I was with my squad.  Well occupying a city, we did what we liked with the men, the women, and the children. They were our playthings.

When it was time to leave, we simply left.  It was weird to think  that one's life was not in the hands of a god, of the  society that you live in. Your life is in the hands of a stranger who lives  a day or two away. They could have been your friend. Instead they slit your child's throat.

I enjoyed this. And I know that my friends do as well. We are monsters. And so monsters I slay.

My favorite childhood memory was when me and a bunch of the other orphans got together to share our food. This was  around the time that we lost our parents, me and my sister.  We had gotten used to the chance of soldiers. We had gotten used to the sound of horses.  For one moment, we felt like we had our community again.  After the war, our community had strengthened.  That moment was the start of recovery.

While stationed for a Siege, one of my buddies went AWOL. I had to find him as he had to take my shift. I found him with a young girl, tied at the hands. She was just a plaything.  It was in the  house, broken down by the war. Stone rubble and the smell of burnt wood.  There was fresh dry bread, on the Sands of the floor.  There was blood on my buddies hip.  He smiled at me, and said that after him it would be my turn.

I left. I didn't stop him.  I didn't know what to say.

When I saw him again, I didn't bring it up.  I pretended like it never happened.

As we left, I peeked over to the ruins where I saw the incident. Part of the house had collapsed over the spot where they were. Over the pile of wood, vultures.

I let that happen.

Organize some sort of organization that lessens the effect of War. War has been something I've known my whole life. One less soldier who puts his arms down means one less necessary death. It means one more father and a family. But I know that the nature of mankind and other sentience is to take and control.  I cannot stop an ocean, but I can redirect the river.   I know it's possible, even if I haven't seen it before.  I'll be the first.

My ideal life is being a part of a community.  A small one, something like 100 maybe 200 people. I want to manage the security of this place. I want to be the one to train the Young how to defend it from enemies and threats. I want to hide it away. You can't open a door  when you don't know where it is.

I want to spend my days in this community with people who are related to me.  I want to pass away at an old age and then my last moments be reminded of  my Redemption. I could have been like that Soldier in my squad. I don't know where he is now, but I wanted to arrive at the hereafter, for given by the lives that I were required to take and the suffering that I caused.

I know that I will cause much more suffering, I may have to take the lives of those who oppose me, but so long as I do one ounce more of good then bad, then it is not a bad life.

--------------------------------------------------
Character Development Tidbits
--------------------------------------------------
-Went to formal school, hence the accent.
-No serious romantic partners. I am 'saving himself' for my childhood love. But I am weak to beautiful humans/elves with forward personalities. I'll consider my first time to be a proper woman with developed rapport.
-I have a scar on my left knee from hunting in my childhood. It looks like a feather. I also have small scars underneath my right forearm and my right jawline from a fall.
-I enjoy climbing and was taught how to rappel down cliffs and walls.
-I fear cliffs. (Nasty fall that Sylphrena saw)
-I try to keep secrets to myself.
- I will only trust those who have proven themselves to me. Until then, I keep everyone at bay with average manners.
-I'm not too close with my family.
-I adore birds, but know that having pets is not within my destiny.
-I strongly dislike it when people flaunt their wealth.
-I come from a background of proving one's worth, and their attire should reflect that.
-I dislike it when people act rudely to anyone, and will look to disrupt the rude person indirectly. Like slipping a fish in their pocket or something.

My greatest fear is bringing shame to my family through ineptitude. Not being good enough. I will make them proud one day. But until then, I tell no one who I'm affiliated with.

The Glass is half full to me. I hope for the best but expect the worst.

In my comfort, I wear a simple green tunic and black pants/boots combination.


I laugh at most jokes but will try to stifle my laughs.


I show my affection by gifts and physical touch.


I want others to respect me and depend on me.


My weakest aspect is that I keep an emotional distance, in fear that others may use me somehow. Paranoia.


I'm very competitive when it comes to proving one's self, especially in more noble pursuits.


I live to bring honor to my family. Everyone will know who my family is and will have high expectations of them.


I don't like any leader that has not proven their mettle. I prefer a leader elected by the people.


I prefer to be indoors.


I am guilty of enjoying the company of women, sometimes ignoring my friends just to have a proper conversation with a beautiful woman.


I stand for being a contributing member of one's community, not necessarily society. To inspire another generation of leaders.


I rely on my good manners to de-escalate most problems.


If I could, I'd change my passivity. I want to be more assertive and be more savage-like when going for what I want. But that's not within my nature. I'm more diplomatic than that.


I am obsessed with my family, and making them well known throughout the realm.


My greatest regret is losing contact with my childhood friend.


I value trust in my friends. Their trust that I am capable in solving whatever life throws at me.


My signet ring bears the mark of a quill with elven-inspired decorum.

Chapter 3: Survivors
26APRIL2022




Session 1
Upon return home for Divide Day, hoping to see any of his family, Candor sees that his home has been burned to the ground.

He leaves Tangen, his hometown, and goes to Gestal, the capitol. There, he meets a group of people who seek to have an audience with the king.

Jeilani - Homeless Halfling Spellcaster
Tacita - Elvish Woman
Manbun 'Cid' - Human Rogue

And from a description by Jeilani, He may know of Hiss, a nephew of the Barman in the Gestallion Inn.

Upon hearing about the burning of Tangen from Jeilani, Candor states that he can help them, and joins them. They toast to friendship, and Jeilani asks where Candor is from . He lies, stating he's from Daryl.

Seeing the rivalry between Candor and Cid, Jeilani asks them to play hide and seek. They discover both rogues promptly.

He reveals to Jeilani that he does not actually come Daryl, but rather Tangen, where his home has burnt down.

After meeting up with the rest of the group and being caught unaware by Jeilani's ability to telepath to him, Candor goes along with Jeilani's joke and begins to speak Draconic to his as he speaks Abyssal, choosing this language rather than Thieves Cant, as Manbun may understand him. Tacita sees through this and responds in Draconic, embarrassing Candor.

They retire for the night on beef stew. Soon, they will attend a jousting tournament where in the king will have an audience with the winners.

Modern Era Portion
Sanfield: Present Day Twin Cities
ChatGPT Origin Story of Sanfield, The Modern Human World

Separation from the Humans of Caerne. Thousands of years ago. Humans of Sanfield thought Elves and Halflings to be works of fiction. Passionate fanatics modify their bodies to look like them.

In the realm of Artheria, a land brimming with magic and medieval wonders, there existed a town called Sanfield that stood apart from its enchanting surroundings. Unlike the neighboring villages and cities, Sanfield was devoid of any knowledge or presence of magic. It was a place where the marvels of modern technology flourished, while the realm's mystical forces remained distant and unknown.

Sanfield's genesis can be traced back to a time when Artheria faced a significant turning point. The realm was immersed in ancient traditions, with wizards, sorcerers, and magical beings shaping the fabric of daily life. However, as the years went by, a select group of Artheria's citizens began to yearn for something different—a life detached from the influence of magic.

Driven by their desire to break free from the constraints of the supernatural, these pioneers sought refuge in an unexplored corner of Artheria. They stumbled upon a fertile land that offered the perfect setting for their ambitions—an untouched expanse they named Sanfield. Here, they could build a town that would embrace a world devoid of magic, where science and technology would reign supreme.

Sanfield quickly transformed into a beacon of progress and innovation. Its streets were adorned with modern architecture and infrastructure, while the surrounding landscapes remained untouched by the mystical forces that governed the realm. The town's residents were pioneers in the fields of science, engineering, and industry, utilizing their knowledge to shape a new way of life.

In Sanfield, technological marvels abounded. The townspeople marveled at the wonders of electricity, harnessing its power to illuminate the streets and power their homes. Factories hummed with the sound of machinery, producing goods that were the envy of neighboring settlements. Communication devices replaced the need for magical messengers, allowing the people of Sanfield to connect and share information instantly.

The absence of magic did not deter the citizens of Sanfield. Instead, they embraced the limitless possibilities of science and innovation. They crafted intricate mechanical devices, such as automatons and clockwork wonders, that enchanted onlookers with their intricate movements. The town became a center of knowledge and education, with institutions dedicated to scientific research and exploration.

Outside the boundaries of Sanfield, Artheria remained a land steeped in magic. Wizards honed their craft, knights embarked on mystical quests, and fantastical creatures roamed the wilds. Sanfield, however, stood as a bastion of the mundane, a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the pursuit of a world untethered from magic.

Today, Sanfield thrives as a testament to the wonders of science and technology in the midst of a realm permeated by magic. Its citizens continue to push the boundaries of innovation, exploring new frontiers and shaping the future of Artheria. While magic remains a distant and unfamiliar concept within its borders, the town serves as a reminder that there are many paths to progress, and sometimes the most extraordinary feats are achieved by forging a different way.

In any town, several buildings and organizations play foundational roles, providing essential services, infrastructure, and community support. While the specific establishments may vary, here are some key examples:

Town Hall/Civic Center: The Town Hall serves as the administrative hub, housing government offices, council chambers, and community meeting spaces. It is where local governance and decision-making take place, including issuing permits, handling public inquiries, and organizing community events.

School(s): Educational institutions, such as elementary, middle, and high schools, are vital in nurturing the town's youth, providing them with knowledge and skills for their future. Schools serve as centers of learning, fostering academic, social, and personal development.

Healthcare Center/Hospital: A healthcare facility, ranging from a local clinic to a full-fledged hospital, ensures the well-being of the town's residents. It provides medical services, emergency care, and access to healthcare professionals, promoting community health and addressing medical needs.

Police Station: The police station is responsible for maintaining law and order, ensuring public safety, and upholding the rule of law within the town. Police officers patrol the streets, respond to emergencies, investigate crimes, and enforce regulations, fostering a secure environment.

Fire Station: The fire station and its firefighters are essential for rapid response to fire incidents, accidents, and other emergencies. They conduct firefighting operations, rescue operations, and provide public safety education, safeguarding lives and property within the town.

Library: A public library is a hub of knowledge, literacy, and community engagement. It offers access to books, digital resources, and educational programs, promoting literacy, learning, and cultural enrichment for all ages.

Community Center: A community center serves as a gathering place for residents, fostering social interactions, and providing recreational activities. It may host events, sports facilities, clubs, and programs that promote community engagement, well-being, and unity.

Market/Shopping Center: A marketplace or shopping center is where residents can access goods and services. It houses various shops, stores, and businesses, including grocery stores, boutiques, restaurants, and other retail establishments, catering to the needs and desires of the community.

Places of Worship: Religious institutions, such as churches, temples, mosques, or synagogues, provide spiritual guidance, a sense of community, and religious services for residents practicing different faiths. They often serve as focal points for community events and celebrations.

Nonprofit Organizations: Nonprofit organizations, such as charities, community foundations, or social service agencies, play a vital role in addressing social issues, supporting vulnerable populations, and enhancing the quality of life within the town. They may focus on areas like healthcare, education, social welfare, environmental conservation, or cultural preservation.

These foundational buildings and organizations create a framework for the town's functionality, connectivity, and overall well-being, fostering a sense of identity, community, and shared purpose among its residents.

Cyberpunk City. Comes from Humans who traveled by ship. Silicon was present in local mines.
(Not sure if humans should come from the mainland or 

Jutamadre was 2 cities previously. But the threats outside the 2 cities kept them together.
Civil War occured. This created the need for prosthetics. The research spilled into computer wear.
City is now cyberpunk. Companies are more powerful than the government. Organized crime. Everyone is fighting for more power.

Solarpunk
There’s 3 factions
The Status Quo (Name WIP)
They want to keep things the same. The tech lives in harmony with the environment.

The New Era
They’re another political party that’s found another tech type. It’s more efficient than what they have, taking advantage of the environment’s many resources. (One of them is harvesting a non-magical crystal called Cabault.)

A third group wishes to combine both technology. Creating this tech will take time, and the other groups know this.

The Fog problem
In the distance, a large cloud that threatens to shut down all the power grid. It’s been recorded by flyers to be moving in their direction for the past few weeks. Samples are inconclusive as to how long it’ll stay in the air.
Status Quo says the residents just need to be patient.
New Era demands that they need to start adapting the new tech NOW, before it’s too late.
Third Group needs more samples. They can develop the tech, rig an inefficient system that will work. Cost is that the new tech will most likely be used up.

Both the Status Quo and the New Era have greedy entrepreneurs that benefit from either decision.

It falls on the party to find which is the best solution.
The solution will change their society forever.

Virasana needs
-Source of Economy
(Mikey's Take: The flora and fauna in the area are the town's main source of economy. Only the tribespeople have intimate knowledge of the area, only they know how to get these rare ingredients and materials from the land around them. A record of 3 Voltanica war parties have tried to collect the materials, even kidnapping the tribespeople to collect the material for them, only to fail to disease, weather, dangerous terrain and beast attacks. The animals remember the Voltanica raiding parties, so they avoid humanoids or attack them on site. This only increases the value of a tribesperson, as they can still collect materials with ease.

The beast themselves and the materials they create are unique and unmatched in the world. Leather hides from a certain animal are as tough as steel. organs that can be turned into health potions, mana potions that recover a spell slot].)

-The Town
(Mikey's Take: The village is one of the many settlements that the Vira Sana tribe frequent, as they are nomadic like native Americans. The town is a mixture of stone and wooden buildings built down into the land. The population is small. Some people stay all year, some migrate to the other Vira Sana villages with the seasons.

Most tribespeople listen to the Elders. [Maybe one of them is a highly regarded elf/dwarf due to the long life span? Maybe druidic? Liv is really into Paganism, and I've even made some gods for her. Maybe they believe in those.]

The town is self-sufficient, but they also see the benefit of trade. Not so much for gold, but bartering. They find modern luxuries incredible, so they often trade with adventurers.
They are wary of any large group, as the Elders still remember Voltanica. The village that the players see is just a small portion, where they are allowed. This is where the bartering happens.

Campaign: The Tale of Raq

Previously, at the lab, Kori's mother informed them about the Konnor grant. She insisted that they visit the medical unit for a thorough examination of their injuries and to reevaluate Kori's infection. Consequently, they were led to separate medical bays for assessment.

Raq underwent examination, with the doctors inspecting her R.A.I.N.E. Gear and requesting its removal. However, as she attempted to comply, she momentarily blacked out, experiencing a brief red-tinted vision. Upon regaining consciousness, Raq discovered hooded figures wearing plague masks, including Dr. Prodrigo, who exclaimed, "That belongs to me!"

A battle ensued, culminating in Dr. Podrigo managing to escape through a hole in the wall, likely from one of the punches. Raq, determined, pursued him. Meanwhile, due to the commotion, Kori hurried to Raq's bay room and was shocked to find that she had fatally injured the doctors attending to her and severely harmed her own mother.

It was revealed that Raq's hallucinations were a result of the Berserker soul infused into her R.A.I.N.E. Gear by Bruno. The idea behind the Berserk soul was an attempt by the doctor to bind two souls into one body, overwhelming the mind. However, since a body is meant to house one mind and one soul, this caused Raq's mind to fracture while her body became bulkier, resulting in the berserker state.

This psychological phenomenon of the mind splitting could be referred to as "Harvey's Dent" or "Hyde Fracture" for now, or something along those lines.

Parts
The Recap
New about the court case. About the riots earlier that week. Talk about some celebrity visiting Ranlean.
Kori’s Mom: Hmmm. This is… on you. The gear isn’t coming off.
…Hey, coco… does your class have… show and tell?
2 Days later.
Kori and Raq are at school. Students are asking about what happened.
There’s a petition for the carrying of arms. Ranlean Hall wants to ban the popular custom of carrying weapons around town. “The world outside of Ranlean is dangerous. And until that perimeter wall is built, we’ll have to deal with wild animals coming in and out of the city. We need our weapons.”

I want a DnD adventure about an 18 year old half-orc barbarian woman named Raq. Raq is exiled from her hometown Ranlean because she was controlled by an evil force called the Rot Wizard. The Rot Wizard controlled her, killing several scientists that were trying to remove a robotic exoskeleton off her.
 Raq is accompanied by a former celebrity hero named Kazka. Kazka is a tiefling who has fallen on dark times and has become a drunk. Kazka introduces her to several mentors, who are all different classes in DnD. After being mentored by one of the mentors, she goes on a quest to prove to her hometown that she is not responsible for the deaths of the scientists. ( The mentors are all in different parts of the Tria Prima.)
The first mentor is a druid that contacts the others through magic. Raq must prove to them that she is worthy of learning from all these different mentors.

The training boosts her up to Lvl 10.

Raq’s Redemption
Raq is exiled. She needs to prove that she wasn't responsible for the Facility Attack.
It was the Rot Wizard.

Her Gear still works.
She meets Kazka.
Kazka is well known to be a Savior. It has been 2 years since Fumir left him. He knows where she is.

After the Einkhala Mission, he realized that he would be rejected by Fumir. He slinks back to his old ways.

Through Raq's mother, he realizes that Raq is Grum's daughter.

They need to leave. They travel to where Kazka has been on his many quests, meeting with the adventurers that once helped him.

With no other knowledge, Kazka goes to the adventurer's guild. They can use Kazka's status as a tool to hide and the quest board to travel to find mentors. Kazka can also grow by retracing his career. This is an adventure to the East. 

1st Stop Sornes - The Desert, and Straphan Forest.
Mission to Protect the Carriage. The carriage holds medical supplies headed to the Eastern Front, for the Tieflings.

The Rot Wizard is following them. Laughing that poor little can't go home.
He wants his Gear Back. It's one of a kind. The technology can be multiplied. Given to his army known as the Hollowed Body. He has recently made connections in the Sornes desert, with someone that specializes in Industrial Robotics. They know of Kazka. he's fought with their bionic lizards before.

The world of magic will cease. The Unmorrows will rise. 

By this time, The Rot Wizard has a squadron of Hollows, 10 units strong. They are strong enough to kill even someone like Kazka.

They see a dragon fly overhead.

2nd Stop The Swamps.
Tieflings are angry that their hero is traveling with the enemy. They follow them relentlessly. Raq's mother advises them to go to their hometown. She gives him a bottle and a scroll of true wildchange.

There they blend in. Looking for a mentor for Raq.

The Orcs have revealed a middleman. The Rot Wizard. He has taken advantage of the Orc race. They are a species that does not rely on Magic. Though primitive, they have potential.

Dr. Podrigo will use the Hollowed Host to further the orcish regime. They will have a place next to him.

By this time, The Rot Wizard has 3 units of Hollows, 30 strong. Each soldier can kill a squad of orcs/tieflings.

they see  dragon riders, flying in V formation.


3rd Fumir
Kazka hears about Fumir. This opportunity cannot be wasted. He must decide on finding a mentor for Raq or traveling to the Tiefling Lands to find her.

The Tieflings and the Orcs are headed North East. to Amethyst Peak.

By this Time, Raq can go home. her exile has ended. She has proof. Dr. Podrigo will be vilified.

If Kazka chose to stay with Raq, then his chance to see Fumir has gone.

If Kazka chose to leave Raq, then he sees Fumir. They have a moment. Fumir is not like Kazka. She's lost too much. She's lost Jerry, Grum. Choosing to leave Kazka was one of the hardest decisions she had to make.

She reveals that she kept a burnt photo of her and Jerry, a tribute to their friendship. She had Grum's sword smelt into her staff, to remind her to keep fighting through the tough times.

She then reveals a ring on her necklace. His ring. carved from their horns.
was a reminder of what could have been. a good life. a family. children. a home in a good neighborhood in Amethyst Peak.

She gave it all up, to be with her people. They needed her. and she needed them.

And now this war threatens us all. Our people.

Things have changed. Fumir has given up who she once was, for the person she is now.


The Rot Wizard
Chronological Order

“The Parasite was a specimen that was the catalyst to my realized dream. It bit Konnor, which created the Hollows. Then, Konnor bit Kori, the 2nd Generation of Hollow. It created a magic user. It brought forth the magic laid dormant in all of us.
This is great news. We can compare the generations and isolate the difference. I’m one step closer.”

“Konnor, the first hollow, was the hypha of sentient life. Devoid of magic. My strains will be better with each generation until we can be removed of the disease called magic. Until then, the hollows will be my lab hands.”


“My study is in the field of mushrooms. Why? Because mushrooms are decomposers. They break life down to their basic elements. All things come to an end. We return from whence we came.”

And magic is a perversion of that. If it means using magic to destroy magic, then it will be done.”

I deal in the dead. Decomposition. Autopsies. It’s fascinating. Chorbishop Cali, the religious official of the First Church, came to me with a wagon full of dead bodies. Exposed to the airborne agent. Dead. Every single one of them is magic users. I set that fire.”

I won that court case as Dr. Podrigo. The Darkwaters were in my back pocket. And in the newspapers, they published my victory.

It changed things. (Lex Luthor?)

Raq’s Redemption.
In the sprawling city of Ranlean, Raq, a spirited and headstrong individual, found herself unjustly exiled from her homeland. Stripped of her former life, she embarked on a journey of self-discovery, traversing untamed lands and encountering a group of remarkable mentors who would shape her destiny.

As Raq ventured into the wilderness, her path crossed with Kazka, a formidable figure who possessed a unique combination of strength and mystic prowess. Kazka, a Paladin and Warlock, took Raq under their wing, imparting the wisdom of divine power intertwined with eldritch forces. Under Kazka's tutelage, Raq learned the delicate balance between light and shadow, mastering both the art of combat and the arcane secrets that danced upon the edges of reality.

In her travels, Raq also stumbled upon Natali, a Bard whose melodic talents enchanted the hearts and minds of all who heard her songs. With a flick of her fingers upon the strings of her lute, Natali revealed to Raq the power of music and storytelling, teaching her the art of persuasion, inspiration, and the delicate dance between words and deeds.
On her journey, Raq also met Zephyr, the serene Monk, who imparted wisdom about balance and self-discipline. Raq learned to harness her inner strength and harmonize her body and mind
Finally, there was Thorne, the ingenious Artificer, who introduced Raq to the wonders of tinkering, engineering marvelous contraptions, and harnessing the power of invention.


In the shadows of a moonlit grove, Raq encountered Candor, a nimble and elusive Rogue. Candor, with their mastery of stealth and cunning, revealed the secrets of the shadows, training Raq in the ways of subterfuge, dexterous acrobatics, and the art of silent and deadly strikes. Under Candor's watchful eye, Raq learned to navigate the treacherous paths that lay concealed from prying eyes.

As Raq continued her journey, she crossed paths with Cerwind, a seasoned and experienced Ranger. Cerwind, a master of nature's lore, taught Raq the ways of survival in the wilderness, from tracking elusive prey to harnessing the power of the natural world. In the tranquil moments spent under Cerwind's guidance, Raq discovered her connection to the untamed forces that dwelled within her own spirit.

But the tapestry of Raq's mentors did not end there. Along her adventurous path, she encountered additional mentors, each with their own unique classes and expertise. There was Ravana, the fierce Fighter who honed Raq's combat skills, pushing her to push her limits and fight with unwavering resolve. Elysia, the wise Cleric, guided Raq in matters of faith and healing, teaching her to channel divine energies to mend wounds and ward off evil.

On her journey, Raq also met Zephyr, the serene Monk, who imparted wisdom about balance and self-discipline. Raq learned to harness her inner strength and harmonize her body and mind. Ember, the enigmatic Druid, revealed the mysteries of the natural world, teaching Raq to commune with the spirits of animals and harness the elemental forces.

Among the mentors, there was also Grakka, the fierce Barbarian, who guided Raq in embracing her primal instincts and tapping into the raw, untamed fury within her. Sybil, the mysterious Sorcerer, awakened the latent arcane powers that slumbered within Raq's blood, unraveling the secrets of sorcery and the manipulation of magic. Finally, there was Thorne, the ingenious Artificer, who introduced Raq to the wonders of tinkering, engineering marvelous contraptions, and harnessing the power of invention.

Through the guidance of this diverse group of mentors, Raq's exile became a transformative journey, filled with challenges, discoveries, and personal growth. With each mentor imparting their unique skills and perspectives, Raq forged her own path, blending the lessons learned to become a force to be reckoned with—a beacon of resilience and strength in the face of adversity.

The Patron
At the Moment, there is one Patron. The very same patron that brought upon the Promise that Shattered the World. The Patron, coming from a world of pain and suffering, has adjusted to Artheria. No longer does it feel the constant burning of its home plane.

The Patron took the form of a giant tentacle creature, its tentacles moving autonomously in response to any kind of pain and suffering. Just the emotional sense placed light pressure in the mana fields. The tentacles would seek to destroy before whatever the threat destroyed the Patron.

At first, The Patron laid a trail of destruction, as it was all it knew. It was its form of communication. But the patron would lose its strength. It needed rest.

The Patron learned to control its tentacles, watching soldiers pause and relax before engaging in warfare. It learned to control its destructive impulses. It was pleasant, simply not doing anything.

Creatures from the Patron’s plane fed through consuming the mana off each other. With the introduction of a pause in combat, the Patron also wondered what the effects of not feeding,

Some soldiers managed to remove portions of the Patron. It made the patron smaller. With every episode of fighting, the patron was getting smaller and smaller. And as it did, The hunger lessened. 

WIth this knowledge, The Patron began to experiment with how much of himself he could lose.

As per his agreement with the scholar, He was tasked to end the war. Using a great flame, he burned large portions of himself to create the Dark Fog. It smelt of rotten burning flesh. It stopped the Orcs from advancing. The Dark Fog had the Patron’s part that enabled his regenerative abilities. He could absorb this place back at any time, but chose to leave it in a dungeon.

The next thing he did was remove its giant eye. The eye was large. It acted as the center where his flesh would recollect.
Forgotten Eye. (Heart?)

The mana required to remove these things from itself was massive. The Patron was now the size of any sentient.Using the very magic that the other beings were using in this world, The Patron cast a spell on itself to take the form of a human. It learned the ways of humans. It learned many things.This was an excursion of years.

The Patron’s efforts and the help of his siblings enabled the orc war to end.



With the Orcs fought off and the war ended, The Patron’s task was done. He was to go back to his plane of suffering. This, he did not like. The Patron put the remainder of its mana into a spellbook. He had become fond of using magic. The spellbook acted as his journal. The Patron’s Spellbook.

Pacts take a toll on both parties. The Scholar was dying, the pact continuing to sap his energy. The Scholar was growing older at a rapid pace. He sent out adventurers to find the Patron. The Patron was eventually caught. After the creation of its spellbook, It was too weak to reabsorb the Dark Fog, nor its heart or its Spellbook.

WIth the last of his energy, the Scholar had prepared a Banishment Spell. It took the form of a wooden axe.

This Banishment would absorb the Patron, giving its life essence to the caster.

Before the Banishment Spell could be successful, the Patron tricked the Scholar. The Scholar himself was banished into the Patron’s realm of pain and suffering. The Patron absorbed him. He also absorbed his age, and the fading mana of the Scholar. However many years the Scholar had, the Patron had left. The Patron was now mortal.

The Patron lived the rest of its life out as a mortal human woman. The attempted banishment, as well as the Patron being split into 4 total parts messed with its passing away. 

The Patron then met Kavik. An Adventurer. Kavik was hungry for power. The Patron gave it to him. But it warned Kavik that the price for the power was pain and suffering. It is the price for its power. Invisible tentacles would sap and facilitate the pain of suffering of not only Kavik but those around him. Kavik would not listen.

The Patron’s body passed away. But its essence was transferred into Kavik’s essence. A deal was made. Kavik would enable The Patron to enjoy a life of adventure through his eyes, his senses. Because the Patron could not do this. The Patron could not explore the peace that this world had to offer.

Whenever Kavik needed to talk to the Patron, he was tapping into the eye. 

Kavik then became a renowned adventurer. Kavik had a son. Kazka.

The Scholar’s community learned of the failed banishment. They began to hunt Kavik down to extract the Patron from him.

Wanting Kazka to be more powerful than him, Kavik passed the Patron over to him. The cost of the transfer being Kavik’s own passing shortly later. Kazka then went on to become an adventurer like his father, unknowing of who the Patron really was.

Zeph Epilogue (From when I DM’ed for random players on rolegate, 2018?)
Only in the village of Eylon can you find High Elves and Drow living in harmony; its natural stone walls protecting the glade it surrounds. Though the elven guards do great work patrolling in the day, the Drow do better. Nothing gets past them in their element.

As such, their composite High Elven/Drow crafts are well protected. If only more merchants came to spread their wares.


The elder Drow of the village see promise in you, seeing how nimble you climb the walls and respond to situations with intellect. Your guard position at such a young age reflects that. Or could it be pity, for what happened to you not too long ago...

It's not enough. As the days and weeks pass, you feel stagnant in this small city. The elders never let you out of their sight. Out there is a world of chaos. Experiences. Something in you thirsts for it.  Is the world outside these walls your calling? You're not really sure what to do with your life.

Really the only thing worth staying for is...her.

As you daydream of this during your shift, you are pelted in the face by something soft and wet. It drags down your leather armor and plops on the stone floor.

Looking down, you see a small cloth bag. As soon as you open it, the smell of rotten bugs and spiders fills your nostrils.

"Don't fall asleep on guard duty, Zephy!"

You need not peer down into the bright darkness. It's the voice of Azurt, the high elf son of the village toolsmith. He's followed by his usual gang of cronies.

"Wouldn't want a clan of goblins attack us now would we?" The entourage laughs at this. They only hang around Azurt for his money. What little his family has more of than the rest. "The only good you have are your eyes. If it was my shift, the village would sleep peacefully."

Today, he has gone too far.

1: Teach him a lesson with your fists. The Drow believe in displays of strength to establish dominance.

2: Let this go. No other guards saw this. Relations between the drow and elves here are tense. Your people are not the violent maniacs the world believes they are.

1
Without pause, you deftly climb down the 20ft stone face with absolute dexterity, and are inches away from Azurt's face. Before he can say a word, you reel back a fist and punch him square in the nose. There is an audible crack as he goes down.

His cronies rush you. Quickly overpowered,  you are beaten to the ground and promptly pissed on.  You are a shamed and bloody mess. The space behind your left ear is especially tender and wet.

When you return to the orphanage, your close friend Zedana treats your wounds with a soft, familiar touch. You dare not mention this.

-1 Hit Point Damage
-small scar behind your left ear





2 You return to your post, unbent. Unaffected. Azurt and friends laugh at you off, and leave. The smell lingers on your armor.

The next dusk (as drow meditate in the day) you are approached by a drow elder, and told it's best you quit. News of what happened spread quickly, and the drow will not trust someone who cannot protect themselves, much less the village. Return your things.

1
The following dusk, (as drow meditate in the day)you are removed from your post by the high elf elders. They tell you to return your guard equipment and go.


As you stand in the armory, you bathe in your emotions privately. This is it. This was the final straw. Ashamed and Angry, you decide to leave now. Right now. That will show the village. And you'll take some supplies as well.


Azurt's guard armor catches your eye. You never noticed before, but it does have a glimmer in the interior. You discover that it has magical properties, a touch gem inside the right interior pocket. It must be nice having a smith for a father.

1 Damage it and show it to his father. His father is an angry drunk. Must be a tradeoff for his smithing skills.

2 Swap it with your uniform. They're identical, save for the gem inside.



"You're leaving, aren't you?" A soft, sweet voice whispers.

You turn to Zedana. Had you packed quicker, she would not have seen you disappear into the night. No words come to mind, to make up for you leaving her.

She walks closer to you.

"...I knew you would one day. I can't see you living your whole life in Eylon. The calm and quiet isn't for you. You're meant for more."

She rummages through her stuff, and produces a few gold coins, a used healer's kit, and some rations. She shoves them into your chest.

"Promise me you'll be safe. I can't patch you up like I did when we were kids when you're gone.

Eat well. And don't steal if you can't help it. I know you're good at it, but it hurts people in unexpected ways, you know?"

Zedana looks into your eyes, as if to commit their red hue in memory. 

She gives you a smile, but her lips quiver ever so slightly as she turns to rest her elbows against the window pane. Soft moonlight caresses her figure.

"Come back soon. Come back safe."

"I'll be here when you return."

1 Hug her. It's something high elves do. To show affection?

2 Turn to leave. The longer you stay the more drow might see you leave the village.



You wrap your arms around her gently, forcing an odd sigh from the both of you. She's warm. Like those torches humans sometimes carry. She's unsure of what to do, her hand around your forearm. She drops her hand quickly.

"Go. Before the others see."



The fellow guard buys your excuse of needing you elsewhere. As soon as he's around a building corner, you lift the gates enough, and roll underneath as it closes.


You take one last look at the village you call home. Where you were bullied all your years. Where Zedana resides. 

Anger is burning in your eyes and stomach. Your mind has cooled. Zedana was right. You're meant for more than this peaceful, safe glade. As you disappear into the dark of the woods, you know that you'll prove it when you one day return.

You make your way west, to prolong the night.

-the ‘how dop you want to do this’ deaths need to stay.

what needs to go?

setting the initiative turn order.
have a turn order that plainly shows the monster’s AC.
when a player wants to cast a spell, the spells take into account the monster stats.
there’s just a big button that ends the turn.
and big counters that stay on one’s screen to count round negatives.
