Eli and Argo had been employed at a tavern for a short period, earning 16 silver each. However, they were soon entrusted with a new task by the tavern keeper's brother, who worked as an excavator. Along their journey, they stumbled upon an injured horse and valiantly rescued it. Continuing their quest, they eventually located the excavator and successfully solved two challenging puzzles. As a result, they reached an agreement to receive one-third of the discoveries made during the excavation. With this session coming to an end, they concluded their day's work.

In the second part of their endeavors, Jasoon and Yoshua, acquaintances from restorative college classes in a bustling town, decided to forgo studying and engage in mischievous activities, playfully tossing objects and exerting a negative influence on each other. However, Yoshua eventually departed, lured by the call of a passing tribe of barbarians, who claimed to be on a path toward physical strength and improvement.

After Jasoon acquired knowledge of healing magic at the college, fate brought him and Yoshua together again. Yoshua had been abandoned by his tribe for neglecting cardiovascular exercise and leg training during battles with their enemies. Following a night of heavy ale consumption, the two made a solemn promise never to part ways again and embarked on a journey to aid others and "secure more gains," as Yoshua eloquently put it.

During a robbery incident outside a bar, Eli, also known as Elikaen, found herself in a precarious situation. However, her rescue arrived in the form of Argo, a small Gnome who gallantly fought off the assailants due to their despicable appearance. After sharing some drinks, they realized that the town held nothing more for them.

Recognizing a shared connection, they decided to travel together. Argo sought to overcome the haunting nightmares of past traumas, while Eli pursued the elusive figure known as "The Betrayer."

As the two parties debated the correct route to a nearby town, they were suddenly attacked by bandits. Acting swiftly, the four individuals joined forces and made a hasty retreat to avoid further confrontation. Injured and depleted of mana, they now needed to find a safe haven to rest and plan their next course of action.

Chapter 1: Kindred Spirits

Argo's Journal Entry

Satur, 19th Septum, 3020 (2 Days Ago)

The voices grow louder, more persistent.

Some nights, I manage to find solace, only hearing the occasional sound of a baby's gentle cry from a nearby crib. On those nights, I can find some semblance of sleep.

But last night, it was different. The anguished wails of a grieving mother pierced the air, as if she had suffered a tragic loss.

Perhaps it's something about this city, this town that amplifies the voices within my mind.

I have made up my mind. I am leaving. This is my final decision. I will take up odd jobs along the way to earn a meager coin and keep myself alive. My body is strong and nimble; it can endure the hardships.

I am heading East, where rumors speak of a tranquil and serene land. A place where the nights are cool, the days are warm, and the peace will drown out the tormenting voices within.

Eli's Journal Entry

Satur, 19th Septum, 3020 (2 Days Ago)

For weeks now, I have been diligently tracking a group of five riders. Their leader, a large man with a silver mane of thick, graying beard, stands out among them. One of his companions sports a peg leg. They are headed East.

I have been tailing them, step by step. But my supplies are running low, and I find myself with only nine coppers left to my name. I spot a tavern up ahead, its signs indicating development and potential opportunities. Perhaps they are in need of assistance.

1: Delivering to a Ruin Seeker

Argo and I meet at the tavern, and fate intertwines our paths. We work there for a few days until the tavern owner sends us on a mission to aid her sister, Malachi. Along the way, we come across a wounded horse and extend our help, naming her Macy. Finally reaching Malachi, we unravel two perplexing riddles and gain entry into an Elven dungeon.

Puzzle:
"Speak my name, and I am broken. Seldom heard, and never spoken."

"Trust not your eyes, for they hold you back. Believe not your mind, a sound obstruction. Swift as the wind, for stillness you lack. The way is open, a ghost's construction."

Yoshua's Journal Entry

Satur, 3rd Octor

Fuck. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. Fuck, in all caps.
Dear Journal; FUCK.
St. Gabriel and I have lost our way. We heard rumors of treasure hidden within ancient Elven ruins. I thought it would be a grand adventure, a chance to earn coin for quality meat to fuel my gains.
But we lost St. Gabriel. He fell into a hole.
I have been stranded here for a day now. Shit, I'm starving.

Elikaen's Notes:
Eli's thoughts on St. Gabriel

Maybe the gods are more flexible with what one can achieve. Perhaps it is the constraints of organized religion that hold back those who are destined for greatness.


Eli's thoughts on Argo:

Eli finds herself placing more trust in St. Gabriel compared to Argo, primarily because of the unsettling night terrors that Argo experiences. The presence of these nightmares raises doubts in Eli's mind. Argo's lack of complete honesty also conflicts with his usual character, leaving Eli uncertain about who Argo truly is. The trust she once had in him begins to waver, making her question whether Argo is the person she initially believed him to be.





Yoshua's Encounter and the Battle with the Dryad

After a day of being stranded, Yoshua's luck took a turn when he stumbled upon the same hole where he lost St. Gabriel. To his surprise, he found Eli and Argo waiting nearby. Eager to test their strength and determine if they were worthy companions, Yoshua challenged them to a fist fight. Through a heated brawl, the trio proved their mettle, showcasing their skills and determination.

During their exploration, they came across an Orcish Sword, a formidable weapon that Yoshua claimed as his own. Empowered by this newfound weapon, they continued their journey deeper into the wilderness, where they encountered a menacing Dryad. A fierce battle ensued, and with their combined efforts, they managed to defeat the formidable creature.

Amidst the aftermath of the battle, they discovered an intriguing Elven Ring adorned with a striking green gem inlay. Recognizing its potential significance, they kept the ring as a valuable artifact.

Reunited with Malaci, the brother of the tavern keeper, they shared the news of their encounters and victories. Malaci, impressed by their prowess and bravery, welcomed them back and celebrated their achievements. The group's bond grew stronger as they prepared for the next chapter of their journey, united in their shared experiences and the treasures they had acquired.

3: Finding St. Gabriel


Emerging from the Elven ruins through a different entry point, the group is met with surprise by Malaci upon seeing a half-orc among the two individuals he had initially sent in. Confusion turns into a conversation about rewards, with the group expressing their desire to be taken back to Malaci's sister.

During their journey, they cross paths with Yoshua's best friend, St. Gabriel, who offers his healing abilities to tend to their wounded horse. Impressed by St. Gabriel's skills and the bond he shares with Yoshua, the group welcomes him into their fold.

Eventually, they reach their destination where Malachi awaits them, ready to fulfill his promise of rewarding their efforts. As the group celebrates their achievements, Yoshua makes an attempt to forge a romantic connection.

However, their peaceful moment is interrupted by the arrival of an injured Tiefling man seeking help. After providing him with much-needed rest, the man reveals a harrowing tale of a band of horsemen who had previously attacked him. In a twist of fate, the group avenges the Tiefling's suffering by eliminating the band's members, including the man's own children. Overwhelmed by grief, the man flees, intending to return in a few days to bury his family.

With heavy hearts, the group finds solace in a well-deserved rest. Yet, their dreams are plagued by haunting memories and significant moments from their pasts.

Yoshua dreams of the Paladin-Barbarians who once abandoned him, hindered by a boulder blocking his path, a symbol of his perceived inadequacy.

St. Gabriel recalls his mentor, Rafael, who entrusted him with a censer and urged him to embark on a pilgrimage, leaving a mark of soot on the chain as a testament to its frequent use.

Argo's dream transports him back to the raid on his village, where he sits beside his parents, confronted by a raider who belittles his perceived weakness before riding off, leaving destruction in his wake.

Eli's dream harks back to a journey with her mentor to a sacred tree, where a ritual was performed. Though the specifics remain hazy upon awakening, she senses a profound connection and conversation with her mentor.

As the night draws to a close, the group awakens, carrying the weight of their dreams and memories, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead.


With the addition of St. Gabriel to their party, the group sets out on their journey to fulfill Malaci's request of being taken to his sister. Along the way, they come across St. Gabriel, Yoshua's trusted hometown friend and traveling companion, who joins them after using his healing skills to tend to the wounded horse, Macy.

Together, they escort Malachi back to his sister's bar. However, upon their arrival, they notice a certain level of affection between Malachi and his sister, hinting at a deeper bond between them.

During their stay, a wounded man stumbles into the bar, sharing a tragic tale of his family being attacked. He recounts how they showed mercy to a band of horsemen, only to be betrayed in return. The man's children were mercilessly slain before him, leaving him devastated. Determined to seek justice, the group learns that among the raiders, one of them has a distinctive peg leg.

Continuing their journey eastward, the group's attention is caught by the glimmer of a toolbelt. Eli expertly climbs and retrieves it, handing it over to St. Gabriel, who opens it to find a valuable Chainmail shirt worth a significant amount of gold. They proceed to reach the village of Aralon, a modest town offering various establishments including a Tavern Inn that serves non-alcoholic beverages, a weapon shop, Wizard's Corner owned by Magister Greer, Granny Smith Fruits and Veggies, and the Chapel of the First.

Upon arrival, the guards at the town's entrance express suspicion towards Yoshua due to the presence of a nearby clan of barbarian-paladins. However, they allow the group to enter after noticing St. Gabriel's emblem of the First, signifying his affiliation with the church.

In their explorations within Aralon, the group attempts to recruit a pet from Granny Smith's collection but finds that all the animals are too attached to her to leave. The selection includes a donkey, a bear, a horse, and even a giant spider. Adjacent to Granny Smith's place, they encounter a tent housing various magical items. Curiosity draws them closer, and as they approach, they notice a rooster perched on the table, pecking at seeds.

Yoshua, seizing the opportunity, grabs the rooster by the neck, attempting to enlist it as part of their crew. To their astonishment, the rooster unexpectedly speaks in common language, exclaiming, "WHAT THE FUCK-HEELLLLP!"

The guards arrive. They see Yoshua choking the rooster, calling the bird 'Magister Greer'.The guards nod to each other. One approach is to have Yoshua release the rooster. The other draws his sword.A figure peeks out from the Church of the First window, attracted by the commotion. Yoshua lets go. The Magister transforms into human form, ushers them all away. Greer retaliates at the group by charging exorbitant prices. They all leave, but Eli manages to pilfer a scroll of Identify. A Wizard could learn this spell and add it to their spellbook; unfortunately, no one in the group is a Wizard. 

St. Gabriel enters the church. Priest Padre recognizes Gabriel as the student of Archfather Rafael. He asks if Gabriel recognizes him, as they met before when Gabriel was a child. Gabriel only remembers that Priest Padre is weirdly good at fishing. Priest Padre entrusted St. Gabriel with a letter, and 5 plague masks. He sends him off to do good and spread the word of the First by helping those affected by the plague. in the Town of Ranlean. . Gabriel returns, reporting what happened in the church to his team. Argo goes to the busker just outside the inn. It's a blonde human, who's strumming her lute and humming along with her eyes closed. Argo sneaks a catchy melody, which inspires the busker to play louder, to start singing. When she opens her eyes, she sees that she's attracted a crowd. She greets Argo, who she's known from Autumn Fields, their hometown.

Danielle, a fellow street urchin who grew up in the same situation. She remembers sharing a loaf of freshly baked bread with Argo; one of her fond memories. She mentions a sight to see just outside of Aralon; a traveling tavern, with tents set up just outside of it. She'll be there tonight, if Argo needs to see her. Looking at Argo's friends, she looks at Eli. Mentions to her that she reminds her of someone. A man with black and white hair. Eli shakes her head, asking who she thinks she is. Danielle takes her leave. Argo throws her one of his wooden coins. She playfully bites it, saying it's the real deal. She takes off, leaving the group.

4: Travelling Tavern and Dangerous Roads

Travelling
10-12 days, 304miles




As the group discusses their individual motivations, St. Gabriel expresses his dedication to aiding the plagued town of Ranlean on behalf of his church. Eli shares her determination to head eastward in search of something important to her, while Argo emphasizes the need to find solace from the voices in his head, willing to follow anyone who can provide that. Yoshua, ever focused on meat and gains, enthusiastically agrees to accompany St. Gabriel on his mission.

Remaining in Aralon, the party takes the opportunity to stock up on supplies, aware of the long journey ahead. Following Argo's suggestion, they make their way to the Traveling Tavern, surrounded by a few accompanying tents. As they approach, a man in noble clothing exits one of the tents but quickly retreats upon seeing the group. Shortly after, three women leave the same tent.

Eli approaches two tieflings, noticing a dagger on one of their hips while they exchange glances with Yoshua. Speaking in Infernal to maintain secrecy, the tieflings share information about having seen the group's horse, Macy. They explain that their own friends were recently attacked by mounted assailants and initially mistook the party for their attackers. Yoshua convinces them otherwise by performing a magic trick, putting their apprehensions to rest.

St. Gabriel successfully persuades the tieflings to travel with the group toward the east, adding more strength to their party. Argo inquires about Danielle, capturing the attention of the barkeep who acknowledges her beauty. Shortly after, Danielle makes an appearance, stepping out of one of the nearby tents. She engages the party in a drinking contest, where Argo and Yoshua end up getting drunk. St. Gabriel and Eli participate but drink more moderately, with Gabriel stopping after just one drink due to his church's disapproval of alcohol consumption.

At dawn, the group sets out on their journey. Along the way, they spot what appears to be treasure. Yoshua, ever drawn to shiny things, attempts to reach it. However, St. Gabriel uses his detect trap ability and senses that the treasure is not what it seems. Cautiously, Yoshua steps back and decides to use a rope tied to a javelin to retrieve the backpack-like treasure. To his surprise, the javelin slips through the rope, causing the backpack to sink into the ground—a cleverly concealed wooden spike pit trap. Meanwhile, arrows narrowly miss the group, alerting them to the presence of bandits. Argo is grazed by a knife, but St. Gabriel swiftly heals his wound, demonstrating his healing prowess.


The encounter with the bandits ends swiftly and decisively. Argo incapacitates one of them with a punch to the groin, and Eli skillfully dispatches another with a thrown dagger that cuts his carotid artery. Yoshua uses a mysterious metal tool to dislodge a chunk of rock from a boulder, causing it to fall and crush one of the bandits.

Yoshua commands the remaining bandit to run, but as he turns his back, Yoshua swiftly cuts him down, severing his ankles and hips before butchering him into smaller pieces.

Meanwhile, Argo climbs a tree to locate the last bandit, an archer hiding in the trees. St. Gabriel spots the archer and warns Argo of the danger. Acting quickly, Argo throws a dart with a rope attached, connecting it to a nearby tree. As he falls, he wraps the noose end of the rope around the tree he climbed. Using a piton, he turns the rope into a makeshift zipline.

The fleeing archer bandit is hit by Eli's boomerang, and Yoshua's revolver removes his left testicle. Argo throws his boomerang, initially missing, but it returns and strikes the bandit, destroying his remaining testicle and causing it to rupture between his femur.

After the battle, the group searches through the bandits' belongings and discovers signs of their desperation and starvation. Their emaciated rib cages indicate they were forced into raiding as a result of dire circumstances.

Danielle returns and informs the group that the barkeep lashed out at his horses, hoping to deter any potential raiders. The party sets up camp with Danielle joining them at the fringes of the campfire. Eli takes the first watch of the night and is visited by her patron, a being she hasn't encountered in a long time.




Elikaen 1: The Patron Bina



Eli is called to a grove close to the camp. It wasn’t there before. This is the grasslands, after all.

In the center, a dead tree. Taking a closer look at it, a humanoid figure is pressed against the tree, her appearance resembling theatre makeup, as if she’s playing a tree or a dryad. Eli bows to the figure. The figure looks to her, slightly annoyed.

“Oh, you’re no fun.”

Eli stands up at the figure’s gestures. The figure passes her hand across her face. The makeup disappears as soon as her hand passes through. She’s now wearing a skintight jester suit, with blue and green diamonds all over it. The trim  sparkles. The figure spins and dances, doing cartwheels while talking to Eli. She asked why Eli hadn't come to her. “My name is Bina. I am the source of your powers.”

Bina
“This group that you travel with, these men… are they any fun?”

Eli
“I like the small one. And the big one is entertaining.”

“Oh you like the small one? I wonder if you would say the same if you knew where he’s from, what he’s done.”

Eli
“We all have to do what we must.”

Bina
“It won’t help, you know. Finding him. You can’t rewind time. There’s no promise that your life before him would have been any good. Take this from someone who’s lived a loooooooong time.

Eli
“So what should I do?”
*She has a look across her face, showing consideration for her advice.*

Bina
“Your life is your own, you are free to do as you wish.”
*She casts a coy look, a grin on the corner of her mouth.


While doing a front somersault, her suit falls apart at the legs. It becomes a dark green masquerade dress, wide at the hips with billowy silk. She’s wearing a porcelain mask that completely covers her face, only her bright hazel eyes are visible.


Bina
“A question. A serious one at that.”
“Your life after you catch him. After expending justice... What does your life look like?”

Eli
“I… I don’t know.”

Bina
“Hmmmm.”
*Her expression is neutral.

Bina
“...I want to show you something. I haven’t been fair to you. 
You can control fire, yes? maybe even make a few ice cubes. I saw it when you attack one of our own, a the dryad. Burned her bark, threw oil at her. Froze that bandit just earlier today. Did they deserve it, really?”

*She fixes her masquerade dress to sit on a rock, neck exposed to Eli.

Eli
“...”

Bina
*She flashes her a disapproving grin.
“Well. I trust in your decision. I’d like to help you in your aspirations.
*She walks away. The dewy fog of the night seems to thicken. Bina disappears in the fog. Reappears a good distance farther away. 

She’s now in a humble daily dress, sleeves pulled up. Her thick, light brown hair falls to one shoulder.

Bina
I’ll teach you that. Or…

She gestures as if putting on a mask. When she takes it off, she’s gone. She disappears.

Bina reappears behind Eli. She’s  back in her jester suit, juggling colored felt balls without effort. 


She stops her juggling to teach Eli some of her spells.

“My magic depends on illusion. Redirection. At times it requires you to be loud and dazzling so that the real magic is quiet and subtle. Much like the b in subtle. For you to move like the mist, you must say these words… Yes, good, good. Now to disappear as I do, say these words, and rub your eye in such a way where only a single eyelash falls off. Imagine that you are in front of a mirror, looking into your own eyes. Wear that mask, yes, that one. The one that you’ve put between you and the natural world. Gracefully, take it off. Surrender to the wind that soars between the pines. Be the moth, flush against bark. Invisible to the hunter of those who seek you the still moth.

Eli picks up the spells quickly. Bina dances and spins, elated to see Eli disappear and reappear.

Bina
“Okay. I’ve helped you. Now... you help me.”

“I’ve run out stories to tell. My dance, my vigor...it’s become lackluster. I need inspiration.

...I want you to play matchmaker. Help a couple or two fall in love! Theater has, and always will be, the eternal song of warm bodies in the night. You can’t guide those in your party! Far too easy, it has to be true love.

It’ll keep my mind off my ex and his rival.”

Bina appears, face to face, inches away from Eli’s.
“I’ll be watching, dear. Toodles.”

She begins to throw the balls at Eli, they even make a whiz sound as they fly by. When she looks again, Bina is gone. Three circular stones are stacked where she used to be.



5: Journey to Ranlean
Group of airships pass overhead. Group sees that it’s damaged. It heads South East.
A wagon bearing a black stone hex symbol passes by. It’s mostly amazonian women wielding stone clubs. They trade for one of Yoshua’s swords at 7gp. They also tell of their religion, being worshippers of 2 twin gods whose home in the clouds had been corrupted by a betrayer god. Their twin gods had fallen, creating their own home in columns of basalt.

Argo 1: The Spirit



Argo, who had been tasked to keep watch, wakes the group to a lime green figure in the distance. Eli and Yoshua pretend not to see it. St. Gabriel pretends, but is caught.

A ghost takes a corporeal form as a burned woman and pack of cloth. Lime green flames. “Baseplate, Bezel, Arrow, Needle. Baseplate, Bezel, Arrow, Needle. Soak the cork, destroy the evil.” She says over and over and over again. She points further East, then disappears.

They reach Ranlean, and go right to the church as guided by priest padre. They see coffins and a few church elected guards outside.

Yoshua tries to take the cart that some bodies are loaded onto. The guards rush over in a panic. They see St. Gabriel and his symbol. They ask what he’s doing there, and why the big one is taking their cart full of diseased dead in a sarcastic manner. Gabriel responds that he and his friends need the cart for their adventure. When Eli controls the flames towards the bodies, the guards panic even further, moving away as they think they could catch the plague that’s going on.

St. Gabriel enters. He meets Chorbishop Cali.


Cali receives the 5 plague masks and the letter. She reads it, then nods. Asks St. Gabriel to go North of Ranlean, take 2 dead bodies to the Rot Wizard. They accept.

Along the way, they see Dwarven ruins. The door is untouched.St. Gabriel understands this as no one’s been there, and the treasure is still inside.

They go in.

The place is dark. Incredibly dark. The party marches with the only person without darkvision in the center. They are hit with rock traps. On their left, a bucket with cheese. They decipher that mouse have eaten from it.

Bridge
Upon finding a rickety bridge, Yoshua asks Argo to come closer. He suddenly throws him over the bridge. He takes a little damage from the fall.

Episode 5 Ghost appears Guys see an airship after battle far South East Pass through a group of women in black, state themselves as House of Basalt Arrive at the other Church of the First Yoshua takes the cart. the guards out front are visibly upset by this When Eli uses magic, the guards panic. "Just go see Chorbishop Cali inside." St. Gabriel goes inside. talks to the chorbishop. Tells him of the plague that's been spreading. It affects magic users only. Chorbishop gathers the party. "Take these two bodies for examination to the Rot Wizard. North of here, just a day's travel away.


 Along the way, broken ruins along the road.


 The group travel in. after kickin in a series of doors and bypassing a rickety wooden bridge, the group discover a library of sorts.


They read a journal to the right of the library. In an old language and in messy handwriting, Eli reads it as the journal of someone who takes a humanoid form and kills librarians. takes their books home to this place. They find in various coinpurses: 15gold 3 Silver 3 Copper The group find 5 books: -Yellow Blood: A Book of Necromancy -A Book on Blue Dragons -The Autobiography of an Elven Religious figure -History of Lostia (eastern part of where they are). -Apparitions: Spirits book
:
 A green creature that can disappear and change her form appears. She attacks the group
This witchlike creature has rough green skin, greasy hair. mud cakes her feet.


 DM's Blunders "As you travel along the road, you see another group of travelers, a wagon that's all black. black wagon canvas, dark grey wood, they wear black robes. One of them is a hulking half-orc, possibly full orc." (SG) "Okay." "Roll a religion check." (SG) "Why"



The bridge falls after Yoshua runs through it. St. Gabriel and Eli traverse over the gap by using rope. Argo helps by deploying his grappling hook and rope.

They enter a library. On the right of the library, a journal of dirty handwriting. It’s the journal of something that kills librarians.

They find several little rooms filled with books. After discovering a good handful of coins, they find five books.





Yellow Blood: A study of Necromancy
Scales of the Shore: A Blue Dragon Informational
Friar Birel Lialdon: Life of a Elven Follower
Eastern Affairs: War of the East
Farm Beasts: Goblins and other similar folk

A creature attacks, resembling an old woman.

She lets out a shriek as the group attacks her.
The party has seen her go invisible, as well as transform into Yoshua.

6: The Ruins
The call of the green hag has summoned rats, notably a giant rat. Its weight forced the party into the basement of the ruins. It took 6 hours to find the exit, and four hours to pull the wagon to where the Rot wizard should be.

The group take a short rest after having escaped the ruins. Having taken 6 hours to find the exit and 4 hours to travel towards the Rot Wizard, they take a short rest.

------

As the group lean against dead trees and small boulders, they begin to question their trust in each other.
St Gabriel and Yoshua have considerable trust in each other having gone to academy together. Though the time apart may have changed them in unforeseen ways.

Saint Gabriel and Yoshua ask Argo about his background, and learn that he comes from a squalid background; life on the streets.
Family and Village were massacred.
Yoshua asks why he's chosen the life of a bard, and why he does his rituals. Backflips and Drumming.
Argo: I do them because I can.
St Gabriel: Something's up with that.
...

Yoshua:
So, are you two a thing?
Eli
Hell no, we are not a thing. He is just entertaining.
Eli: We've been travelling together for a while, but can we really trust each other?
Yoshua
Listen, I picked y'all up to dodge danger. I'm trustworthy. As proof, here's protein shakes.
Yoshua hands his protein shake rations to each member.
...

Eli to St Gabriel: What do you know of Night terrors?
St.: NIght terrors, huh? It's a manifestation of a negative energy in one's life. It comes in many ways, shapes and forms, but does form as a kind of compensation, Why do you have night terrors?
Eli: No, can you help Argo with night terrors? He bothers me when I meditate at night and I can't get proper rest.

St. to Argo:  Oh, it's you who has trauma? I said it before, it's a manifestation of something negative in your life. Is it caused by something in your past? I would advise to release and rid it from your life; let it go. You'll find more peace of mind if you do. What do you think it is?

Argo: Hmmm...Let's not talk about it right now.

....

Eli to Yoshua: You mentioned you were part of a group, barbarians or paladins. They left you because you didn't want to work on your lower body and cardio. Why don't you do leg day?
Yoshua: Hey, I got us out. It was because of my developed upper body that I managed to get us out. I'm not too certain, but it seems I have some sort of mental block when it comes to the strength in my legs. I work on my upper body to compensate for the mental block that I seem to have on my legs.

...

Eli: What about you, St. Gabriel, where do you get your power? What are you after?
St: After getting the title, to be ordained.
St.: I thought I already was, but I wasn't. 
Eli: Why is your power in your button but not your ability? What can you do with the button? What can’t you do? What spells can you cast? 
St Gabriel
Does this pin restrict me? It restricts me, it gives me a code to follow. 
Eli: Why does status mean so much to you? Why do you put so much power into this pin rather than your own abilities?
St. Gab: I've committed so much to my identity as a member of the First Church, only to realize i was not ordained. My mentor may not be who I thought he was.
Being on this pilgrimage gives me direction.

----



St. Gabriel
How is your trust in us now?
Argo : Higher. I trust you guys a lot more. (meaning to say, given, I would be more comfortable with the deeper stuff)
Argo: How is your trust in us?
St Gab: My trust in you isn't higher. Because it was already high.
Argo trusts St Gab more.
St Gab trusts Argo more.
Yoshua trusts everyone.

Yoshua explains that he seems to have a mental block that prevents him from reaching his full potential.
Eli gains a respect for St Gabriel, for his knowledge in health. Her eyes look at St. Gabriel with a glint of respect.

7: The Rot Wizard
The party encounters the enigmatic Rot Wizard at his small abode, a little north of the town Ranlean. The Wizard is clad in a striking attire of black leather. His residence, nestled deep within the forest, doubles as his laboratory. Fungi flourish in abundance, encircling his abode. Upon their arrival, the party relinquishes the bodies retrieved from their wooden wagon to the wizard, who promptly instructs them to wait outside while he commences his meticulous autopsy. Cautionary whispers circulate among the group, mindful of potential contagions within the wizard's dwelling.

As the hours wear on, boredom slowly infiltrates the party's ranks. Eli, consumed by curiosity, seizes the opportunity to explore further. Through the chimney she ventures, wielding live fire, her intentions fixed on observing the progress of the rot wizard's work. In a desperate bid to safeguard herself from the flames, she involuntarily loses control of her bladder. Simultaneously, driven by her opportunistic nature, she discreetly pockets a few items while navigating the premises.

Meanwhile, the Rot Wizard emerges from his sanctuary, delivering the unsettling news that the affliction at hand might be none other than the dreaded spell plague. Assuring the party that he will imminently journey to the church armed with a rudimentary antidote.

8: New Friends (And the wolf attack)
After having survived an orc attack, the team find themselves in company of Kai, the Warlock Wizard who had been told by the Rot Wizard to leave the premise, and the lone human among the orcs. This lone human displayed amazing combat prowess, hiding almost in plain sight.

Having traveled a few days East, the group review their motives and direction of travel.

They let Squish free, and he proves his trustworthiness by aiding the group when direwolves attack.

A direwolf gets scared off by Yoshua’s command.

Kai gets severely hurt by a Direwolf’s bite. Macy the horse is blown back by Kai’s thunderwave, severely injuring the horse and blowing a hoove off. She now has 3 legs.

The wolves are slain, notably when Eli leaves a dagger in the shoulder blade of one wolf. Argo frontflip kicks it into the wolf’s heart.



Only one wolf survives, running into a camp of muscle bound persons. The camp piles onto the wolf, capturing it. 

As Yoshua goes to speak to the group about the wolf, one sees Yoshua and asks “...Is that you, Yoshua?”

9: The Camp


The party finds themselves amongst a group of strongmen at night. One of them recognizes Yoshua, the paladin.

The meet up with Yoshua’s old people, only to realize that they’re Barbarian Paladins

Alex - The Serious Leader

Steel Paladin - Had a rock thrown at him.

MacStrong - Little Gnome Bodybuilder

-Rana the Raven - Yoshua’s mother figure

While Saint distracts Rana the Raven, Squish pickpockets a few people.

An unknown Paladin leads the group to a small Dungeon, away from the others. The Dungeon is easily solved, Having pie that needs to be eaten, beer that needs to be drunken down, and a final trap of spikes that ultimately fails.

Past Episodes and Notes

6: Old Witch’s Ruins
Rats
Group hears the witch’s howl. Eyes pop out from the darkness. One pair. Two. 4. Eight. 16.
They become enveloped in rats.

Run to bridge

They fall down, into the basement of the castle ruins.

The Dark
Place description
The party falls, partially cushioned by the sheer volume of the rats that fall with them. The hard floor is damp and cold. It smells of mildew and a hint of animal droppings. The air is filled with the clacking of rat claws. A lone bat screeches out and flaps away.

 Some or the rats scatter; some stay and stalk the group as they recollect themselves. 

Text to friends:

Argo
I’ve been travelling with Eli since she saved me at that bar robbery. The city streets that I survived off had nothing for either of us. We left together. Find a way to end these nightmares.

A ghost came to the group. Burned woman, burning in a ghastly green. 
“Baseplate, Bezel, Arrow, Needle. Baseplate, Bezel, Arrow, Needle. Soak the cork, destroy the evil.” What does that mean?

She pointed East. Guess that’s where I’m headed to. That’s where the group is going.

Eli
Saved this gnome during a bar robbery. Had a few drinks with him. Decent guy. Started travelling together. He helps with the jobs I take to earn money. Still looking for ‘him’. My mentor. I still think of the people we hurt, all those years ago.

My patron came to me. Bina. the harlequin, for the first time. Showed me a few new spells. She mentioned my quest to find my mentor, showing disapproval. But that I am my own woman. She will not stop me.

She says her dance lacks vigor. Inspiration. She wants me to play matchmaker, help others fall in love. In return, more spells.

Yoshua
Left my town to get swollen huge. Joined a barbarian clan. They kicked me out because I didn't do leg day or cardio.’ assholes. Found Gabriel, my guy. Dependable. Gonna tag along with him, get more swole along the way.

This is my path to gains.

Saint
I was trained by Archfather Raphael to do good for the people around me. He sent me to Priest Padre, and I accepted to go on a pilgrimage. The first stop was Ranlean, to do what I can about the plague.

In Ranlean I met Chorbishop Cali. She said I am not ordained. Why didn’t Archfather Raphael ordain me?

On the way to the Rot Wizard to deliver this body for examination, We stopped at an unexplored ruins. Inside was a library. We found a monster that resembled a toad woman. She attacked us.
 
I casted magic after being potentially exposed. Now I have a tightness in my chest. We’ve fallen down deeper into the ruins.

Deliver the body to the Rot Wizard. 
Return to Ranlean to be properly ordained.
Continue on my pilgrimage to do good.






Steel Paladin. A Jaded man with a single terrible scar on his back. He is excitable to self improvement, but only this. With everything else, he is numb and passive.

Session 9: The Camp
Social/ Adventure Session

Flashbacks (What did you do?)
Argo - A thief went through your backpack during your street life.
Wokeup, tried to slap with foot.
Eli - You remember one of your mentor’s friends. He was poking at a white crocodile that the group captured. What did you say?
Saint - During your studies, a friend asked to copy your homework. What did you do?
Yoshua - During your travels with the group that left you, a rival stole your food while you weren’t looking. What was it?
Kai - Two of your family members were fighting about an experimental spell. What was it about?
Squish - Despite the malice your family felt in your town, one schoolmate had a crush on you. What did she look like?

Talk about Yoshua leaving the group
NPC 1: The Leader
NPC 2: The Steel Paladin
NPC 3: Yoshua’s Rival
NPC 4: Yoshua’s Auntie: The older woman who took care of him. 
Auntie: Is this the one you were talking about? Your hometown friend?
Morning Passes
Steel Paladin: Let us do some Strength enhancing exercise
Questionable practices  (Notice some slave labor)
What to do with the wolf
Auntie to Yoshua: How’s the group you travel with?
We are travelling to a competition on the other side of the Continent. Heard of it just two weeks ago.
There’s a room here underneath this tree. Some kind of secret room? It has odd writing.

What to offer players: Small trader
Strength buffs
Dungeon quest: Halfway open. 3 rooms. Requires halfing. (first room)
Figured out the first part. (Paladins don’t want the carbs.)
Eating to enter.

Room 1 Simple Physical test. There is a pedestal with food on it. Across the room, a tightrope that goes up a smooth wall, up 15 feet, like 50ft across. At the top, a large boulder and a door. There’s a giant stone pedestral.A pedestal keeps providing food.

 Halflings figured out that other halfings would eat then just sleep. (Can’t throw up. Gnomes teamed up with Dwarves. Physical test is easy, balance on a rope, and push a heavy boulder to a pedestal.

Room 2 Beer test. Halflings thought that if they managed to get through, there should be security to bypass. Dwarves can drink a lot. They could fix that.

Room 3. Goblin Text. Easily bypassable lock. Menacing traps aimed at the treasure box. (They don’t work, they fall apart immediately.)

Inside: Squirrel Heads
A rusty dagger
1 copper
Box of spices
Ingot of Silver
“The story of the trio” (slightly muddled by water.)
Halfing: We met a goblin baby. This one is free of sin. Dwarf wanted to kill it.

Dwarf: Blasted Halfie. Kept the monster. I’ll find my chance to kill it.

Halfling: It’s grown on Him! After 3 months, he’s seen the light.

Dwarf: It’s not so bad. It fetches me tools. Blasted thing’s thinkin’ I’m its mother. Can’t kill it now.

Halfing: We got married. The feast was amazing.

Dwarf: Me lad’s gotten sick. Travelled far and wide for medicine. I know nothing of herbs. Gotta get a healer.

Halfing: Gerard’s gotten real sick. Galmed’s tearing his beard out trying to find a cure. Our baby may not make it.

Dwarf: Here lies Gerard Greenfoot. In our short time together, he’s changed the way I see goblins. The boy’s favorite things. The squirrel trophies he caught himself. Broke a tooth catching them. Forged him a knife. The spices Carrie was gonna use for his upcoming birthday.

Was gonna take him to a Dwarven fest. Dress him up, throw me cap on him. Damn gobby could’ve fit entirely in it. The copper I was gonna pay to get him in. Was gonna make a prime dagger for im to catch all the furries when he got better.

I was too harsh on the lad. I know that. Carr carr saw that. If onl --__---

Ranlean
Saint 1: Inordained
Visiting the Church
Understanding the Plague
The plague seems to only affect spellcasters at the time of casting. Those of the church and of the universities and colleges are getting sick.
The priest takes the 5 masks, keeps one, gives the rest to his assistant.
“St. Gabriel. A saint. A do-gooder. Hmm. Come to the Shrine.”
St. Gabriel prays.
Chorbishop Arel : “What are you doing? You just knelt down. This is a blessed altar. Channel your divinity.
You weren’t…
You weren’t ordained.
She racks his brain, Arel rushes to the altar. She begins to pray. As she does, sunshine floods the room more. 2 glowing wings on both side glow.
What did Rafael tell you exactly? You’re from his church, yes? You can cast magic? So then why...

See the Rot Wizard, in the grasslands. He’ll know what to do.
He leads the group outside, to a wagon. In the wagon, 2 dead bodies.
“Take these to him for examination.in the Grasslands.”

When you get back, I’ll ordain you myself what in the… What is the Archfather thinking?
