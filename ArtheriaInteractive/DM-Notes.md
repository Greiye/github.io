## Adventure Event Checklist
For each adventure, give them 2 events per skill, for all skills.

In D&D 5e, saving throws typically counteract battle or spell effects rather than advance the story. To create a rich and engaging narrative, it's essential to incorporate various skill checks that drive the plot forward.

##### Why bother will individual skill checks? when everything feels party-wide?
In D&D 5e, skill checks are traditionally made by individuals to reflect each character's unique abilities and contributions to the group. However, using party-wide checks can streamline gameplay and enhance teamwork. Here's a deeper look at why individual skill checks are still valuable and how party-wide checks can be effectively used.
Value of Individual Skill Checks

    Character Spotlight: Individual skill checks allow each character to shine in their areas of expertise, highlighting their unique skills and backgrounds.
    Diverse Challenges: Different characters may excel in different situations, creating a dynamic and varied gameplay experience.
    Roleplaying Opportunities: Individual successes and failures can lead to interesting roleplaying moments and character development.
    Balance and Fairness: Ensuring that each character has opportunities to use their skills can make the game feel more balanced and fair.

Effective Use of Party-Wide Checks

    Streamlining Gameplay: Party-wide checks can speed up the game, reducing the need for multiple rolls and keeping the story moving.
    Collaborative Storytelling: Treating the party as a single entity can enhance the sense of teamwork and collective achievement.
    Inclusive Engagement: Ensures that all players are involved in each challenge, preventing any one player from feeling left out.

Implementing a Hybrid Approach

To balance individual and party-wide checks, consider the following hybrid approach:
Individual Skill Checks

    Critical Moments: Use individual checks for crucial challenges where personal expertise is key.
    Role-Specific Tasks: When tasks clearly align with a specific character's skills (e.g., a rogue disarming a trap), use individual checks.
    Character Development: Individual checks that can lead to significant character growth or story development.

Party-Wide Skill Checks

    Common Challenges: For general tasks that the entire party can contribute to (e.g., group stealth, navigating terrain), use the highest modifier or an average roll.
    Group Decisions: When the party decides to work together on a challenge, allow them to pool their skills for a collective check.
    Routine Actions: For routine or less critical tasks, party-wide checks can keep the game flowing smoothly.
