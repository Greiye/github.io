Doing Skill Checks
My personal thing is:
Give them 2 Types of skill checks
Set up the adventure to have the change to use all skill checks.

Strength

    Athletics

Dexterity

    Acrobatics
    Sleight of Hand
    Stealth

Intelligence

    Arcana
    History
    Investigation
    Nature
    Religion

Wisdom

    Animal Handling
    Insight
    Medicine
    Perception
    Survival

Charisma

    Deception
    Intimidation
    Performance
    Persuasion

All Saves seem to be a battle or spell counter rather than a story advancement.

Right from this list, I need to put in a reward. And the reward will have a check.

A Heavy object in the way.
A precarious place that needs quick feet.
An enemy or threat they can avoid
Magic Occurence. Any spell that happens they have a chance of identifying.
History of Culture, architecture, places, events, meeting with people, clothes.
An event that's already transpired.
Trees or plants or animals of some kind. Nature and Animal Handling.
A religion article, which can be closely ties with History.
Automatic Insight check with everyone they meet. Their first initial thought of them, and the validity of their words.
Medicinal Herbs or Procedures. Someone getting hurt. They just need someone to say if they're fine or not.
Survival in the Woods or wasteland. Tied with rations, food, poison, hunting. weather prediction, Or other natural hazards (Identify a natural trap, which is different from a manmade trap.)
Constant perception. (should be differentiated with passive.)
A chance to perform.

with NPC's always do a thing of language.

There is passives for a reason. They don't involve any dice rolls.
Write down what they see and then give it to them.
If Perception, write what they see.
If Investigation, give them the exact series of events.
If Insight
